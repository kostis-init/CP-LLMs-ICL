A fishery wants to transport their catch. They can either use local sled dogs or trucks. Local sled dogs can take 100 fish per trip while trucks can take 300 fish per trip. The cost per trip for sled dogs is $50 while the cost per trip for a truck is $100. The budget is at most $1000 and the number of sled dog trips must be less than the number of truck trips.

A grocery store wants to liquidate its stock of 10 apples, 20 bananas, and 80 grapes. Given past experience, the store knows that they can propose a banana-haters package with 6 apples and 30 grapes and that this package will bring a profit of six euros. Similarly, they can prepare a combo package with 5 apples, 6 bananas, and 20 grapes, yielding a profit of seven euros. They know they can sell any quantity of these two packages within the availability of its stock. What quantity of each package, banana-haters packages and combo packages, should the store prepare to maximize net profit?

Mark prefers to grow more cucumbers than potatoes, but he only has enough resources to grow at most twice the amount of cucumbers as potatoes. If the profit per acre of potatoes is $500 and the profit per acre of cucumbers is $650, how many acres of each should he grow to maximize his profit? What is that profit?

A flooring company produces engineered hardwood and vinyl planks. Their sales forecasts show an expected demand of at least 20,000 square foot of hardwood and 10,000 square feet of vinyl planks each week. To satisfy a shipping contract, a total of at least 60,000 square feet of flooring much be shipped each week. Due to a labor shortage issue, no more than 50,000 square feet of hardwood and 30,000  square feet of vinyl  can be produced weekly.

A doctor's office takes the  temperature of patients one by one either by using an electronic or regular thermometer. The electronic thermometer takes 3 minutes to make a reading while the regular thermometer takes 2 minutes to make a reading. Since the electronic thermometer is more accurate, at least twice as many patients should have their temperature checked by the electronic thermometer than the regular thermometer. Since the electronic thermometer has a cooldown time, at least 50 patients should have their temperature checked by a regular thermometer. If the office is open for 15000 minutes, maximize the number of patients whose temperature can be taken?

Each ultrawide truck can transport 6 tires per trip and costs $700. The company needs to transport at least 200 tires and has available $22000. Because most remote sites don't have proper airports, the number of plane trips cannot exceed the number of ultrawide truck trips. How many trips of each should be done to minimize the total number of trips?

A music company produces two types of digital keyboards, one is full-weighted and another is semi-weighted. Both keyboards are sold for $2800 and $2400 respectively. There are about 3500 oscillator chips available every day from which the full-weighted version requires 20 chips while the semi-weighted version requires 15 chips.

A tourism company can buy sedans or buses to add to their fleet of vehicles to increase their capacity for more tourists. A sedan can seat 50 tourists per day but results in 10 units of pollution. A bus can seat 250 tourists per day but results in 40 units of pollution. The city has limited this tourism company to producing at most 800 units of pollutants per day. To make a profit, this tourism company must take care of at least 4600 customers per day.

A dessert shop is popular for their only two desserts - matcha ice cream and orange sorbet. Two units of flavouring and four units of ice cream is required to make one order of matcha ice cream. Four units of flavouring and three units of water is required to make an order of orange sorbet. The dessert shop has recently been getting more orders online for orange sorbet and therefore, there should be more orange sorbet made than matcha ice cream.

A landscaper has 2500 square feet of grass land in a customer’s backyard where they need to cut grass using either a heavy-duty yard machine or a gas lawn mower. For each square foot of land, the heavy-duty yard machine requires 2 seconds while the gas lawn mower takes 5 seconds. Per square foot, the heavy-duty yard machine produces 12 units of pollution and requires 3 units of fuel. Conversely, the gas lawn mower generates 10 units of pollution for each square foot and requires 2 units of fuel.
