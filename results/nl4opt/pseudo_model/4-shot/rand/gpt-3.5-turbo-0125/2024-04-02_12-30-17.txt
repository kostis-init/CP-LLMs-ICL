A neighbourhood pizza restaurant has opened and sells pizzas in two sizes; large pizza and medium pizza. Large pizzas require 12 units of dough, and 5 units of toppings. Medium pizzas require 8 units of dough, and 4 units of toppings. While large pizzas take 12 minutes to bake, medium pizzas require 8 minutes to bake. The neighbourhood pizza restaurant must use at least 10000 units of dough and 4400 units of toppings. Medium pizzas are popular due to a promotion, therefore, at least 200 medium pizzas must be made. There are regulars that prefer large pizzas and at least two times as many large pizzas should be made than medium pizzas. How many of each size of pizzas should the neighbourhood pizza restaurant make to reduce time spent baking?

Both coconut oil and lavender need to be added to a body wash. One unit of coconut oil takes 0.7 minutes to be effective while one unit of lavender takes 0.9 minutes to be effective. The body wash must contain at least 300 units of coconut oil and at most 550 units of both ingredients. Since too much coconut oil can make the body wash too oily, there can be at most thrice the amount of coconut oil as lavenders in the body wash. How many units of each should be added to the body wash to minimize the total amount of time it takes for the mixture to be effective? (Note: one must be added before the other)
