Question: Baker, Cooper, Fletcher, Miller, and Smith live on the first five floors of an apartment house. Baker does not live on the fifth floor. Cooper does not live on the first floor. Fletcher does not live on either the fifth or the first floor. Miller lives on a higher floor than does Cooper. Smith does not live on a floor adjacent to Fletcherâ€™. Fletcher does not live on a floor adjacent to Cooperâ€™s. They all live on different floors. Find the floors where these people live.

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:

```json
{
    "B": int,
    "C": int,
    "F": int,
    "M": int,
    "S": int
}
```

For example, if Baker lives on the 2nd floor, Cooper on the 1st, Fletcher on the 5th, Miller on the 3rd, and Smith on the 4th, then the answer should be:
```json
{
    "B": 2,
    "C": 1,
    "F": 5,
    "M": 3,
    "S": 4
}
```

Decision Variables:
    Define integer variables B, C, F, M, S to represent the floor where Baker, Cooper, Fletcher, Miller, and Smith live, respectively.

Domains:
    Each variable has a domain of [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] representing the five floors of the apartment house.

Constraints:
    Baker does not live on the fifth floor: This can be represented as:
    B != 5

    Cooper does not live on the first floor: This can be represented as:
    C != 1

    Fletcher does not live on either the fifth or the first floor: This can be represented as:
    F != 5
    F != 1

    Miller lives on a higher floor than Cooper: This can be represented as:
    M > C

    Smith does not live on a floor adjacent to Fletcher: This can be represented as:
    |S - F| != 1

    Fletcher does not live on a floor adjacent to Cooper: This can be represented as:
    |F - C| != 1

    All live on different floors: This can be represented by adding AllDifferent constraints for the variables B, C, F, M, S.

Objective:
    There is no objective function in this problem as we are not optimizing anything. We are simply finding a feasible solution that satisfies all the constraints.

Question: A boy wants to give an apple to a girl. To get to her, he has to pass through five gates, each with a guard. He bribes each guard with half of his apples, plus one. The boy does not have a knife, therefore he gives the guard an integer number of apples. After heâ€™s given the apple to the girl, he has no apples left. How many did he have to begin with and in the process?

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:
```json
{
  "apples": [int]
}
```
where "apples" is an array of 6 integers, each representing the number of apples before each gate, plus the last element being the number of apples given to the girl.

For example, a valid JSON (not the answer) would be:
```json
{
    "apples": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
}
```


Decision Variables:
    Define an array of integer variables named apples to represent the number of apples the boy has before passing through each gate, plus the number of apples given to the girl. The variable 'apples' is an array of size 6.

Domains:
    Each variable in 'apples' has a domain of non-negative integers.

Constraints:
    The boy gives half of his apples plus one to each guard. This can be represented by the equation:
    apples[i+1] = (apples[i]/2) - 1 for i in [0, 4]

    The boy has no apples left after giving the last apple to the girl. This can be represented as:
    apples[5] = 0

Objective:
    There is no specific objective in this problem as we are not asked to maximize or minimize anything. We are just looking for a feasible solution that satisfies the constraints.

Question: A magic square is an n x n grid (n != 2) such that each cell contains a different integer from 1 to n^2 and the sum of the integers in each row, column and diagonal is equal. Find a magic square for size 4, knowing that the sum of integers of each row, column and diagonal has to be equal to n(n^2+ 1)/2 (integer).

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:
```json
{
    "square": [[int]]
}

For example, a 3x3 magic square should be given as:
```json
{
    "square": [[2, 7, 6], [9, 5, 1], [4, 3, 8]]
}
```
This means that the first row of the square is [2, 7, 6], the second row is [9, 5, 1] and the third row is [4, 3, 8].
Decision Variables:
    Define a 4x4 matrix variable named square to represent the magic square.

Domains:
    Each cell in the square matrix has a domain of integers from 1 to 16 (4^2) as the numbers in the magic square range from 1 to 16.

Constraints:
    Different Numbers: All numbers in the magic square must be different. This can be represented as:
    AllDifferent(flatten(square))

    Row Sums: The sum of integers in each row must be equal to the magic constant. This can be represented by adding constraints for each row:
    sum(square[i][j] for j in range(4)) == magic_constant for i in range(4)

    Column Sums: The sum of integers in each column must be equal to the magic constant. This can be represented by adding constraints for each column:
    sum(square[i][j] for i in range(4)) == magic_constant for j in range(4)

    Diagonal Sums: The sum of integers in each diagonal must be equal to the magic constant. This can be represented by adding constraints for the two diagonals:
    sum(square[i][i] for i in range(4)) == magic_constant
    sum(square[i][3-i] for i in range(4)) == magic_constant

Question: Following a robbery at Sparkles the Jewellerâ€™s, Inspector Korner of the Yard interviewed six of the usual suspects. He knew that the getaway car had been barely big enough to hold two, so he reckoned that at least four of them were innocent - but which ones? He also supposed that the innocent ones would tell the truth, while the guilty one or ones would lie. What they actually said was:
- ARTIE: "It wasn't me."
- BILL: "Crackitt was in it up to his neck."
- CRACKITT: "No I wasn't."
- DODGY: "If Crackitt did it, Bill did it with him."
- EDGY: "Nobody did it alone."
- FINGERS: "Thatâ€™s right: it was Artie and Dodgy together."
If the good inspectorâ€™s suppositions were correct, who is guilty?

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:
```json
{
    "artie": 0 | 1,
    "bill": 0 | 1,
    "crackitt": 0 | 1,
    "dodgy": 0 | 1,
    "edgy": 0 | 1,
    "fingers": 0 | 1
}
```

Where 0 means that the suspect is innocent and 1 means that the suspect is guilty.

For example, if the guilty suspect is Artie, Bill, and Crackitt, the answer should be:
```json
{
    "artie": 1,
    "bill": 1,
    "crackitt": 1,
    "dodgy": 0,
    "edgy": 0,
    "fingers": 0
}
```
Decision Variables:
    Define binary variables for each suspect to represent whether they are guilty (1) or innocent (0). The variables 'artie', 'bill', 'crackitt', 'dodgy', 'edgy', and 'fingers' are binary.

Domains:
    Each variable has a domain of {0, 1} where 0 represents innocent and 1 represents guilty.

Constraints:
    Artie: "It wasn't me." This implies that Artie is innocent if he tells the truth.
    Bill: "Crackitt was in it up to his neck." This implies that Bill is guilty if he tells the truth.
    Crackitt: "No I wasn't." This implies that Crackitt is innocent if he tells the truth.
    Dodgy: "If Crackitt did it, Bill did it with him." This implies that Dodgy is guilty if he tells the truth.
    Edgy: "Nobody did it alone." This implies that Edgy is guilty if he tells the truth.
    Fingers: "That's right: it was Artie and Dodgy together." This implies that Fingers is guilty if he tells the truth.

Objective:
    The objective is to determine which suspects are guilty based on the statements provided by each suspect. The solution should be a JSON object indicating the guilt status (0 for innocent, 1 for guilty) of each suspect.

Question: Alice has to give Bob change of 199 euros. She has 6 different types of coins of different value ([1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50]) and she has a certain number of coins of each value available ([20, 10, 15, 8, 4, 2]). How can the change be composed with the available coins minimizing the number of coins used?

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:
```json
{
    "coin_counts": [int]
}
```

For example, if she gives to Bob 1 coin of value 1 and 3 coins of value 25, then the answer should be:
```json
{
    "coin_counts": [1, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0]
}
```

Decision Variables:
    Define an array of integer variables named coin_counts to represent the number of coins used for each type of coin [1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50].

Domains:
    Each coin count variable has a domain of [0, max_coins] where max_coins is the maximum number of coins available for that denomination.

Constraints:
    Total Change: The sum of the products of each coin count and its corresponding coin value must equal the total change to be given, which is 199. This is captured by the equation:
    1*coin_counts[0] + 2*coin_counts[1] + 5*coin_counts[2] + 10*coin_counts[3] + 25*coin_counts[4] + 50*coin_counts[5] = 199

    Maximum Available Coins: The number of coins used for each denomination should not exceed the maximum number of coins available for that denomination. This can be represented by adding constraints for each coin type:
    coin_counts[i] <= available_coins[i] for all i in [0, 5]

Objective:
    Minimize the total number of coins used, which is equivalent to minimizing the sum of the coin_counts array.

Question: We want to assign a different colour to the following countries: Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Netherlands and Luxembourg.
Two neighbouring countries cannot have the same colour.
Read the data below with the graph representing the adjacency of the countries: each pair (i; j) means that country i is adjacent to country j.
You can use integers starting from 1 to represent the colours.
Find a colouring that minimizes the number of colours used.

Here is the data:
{
    "num_edges": 9,
    "graph": [
        [3, 1],
        [3, 6],
        [3, 4],
        [6, 4],
        [6, 1],
        [1, 5],
        [1, 4],
        [4, 5],
        [4, 2]
    ],
    "nodes": ["Belgium", "Denmark", "France", "Germany", "Netherlands", "Luxembourg"]
}

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:
```json
{
    "colors": [int]
}
```
where the list of integers represents the colours assigned to the countries in the order they are given in the input.

For example, a valid JSON (not the answer) would be:
```json
{
    "colors": [1, 2, 4, 2, 3, 5]
}
```

Decision Variables:
    Define integer variables for each country to represent the color assigned to that country. The variable 'colors' is an array of size equal to the number of countries (6 in this case).

Domains:
    colors[i] âˆˆ {1, 2, 3, ...} for each country i. The integer value represents the color assigned to the country.

Constraints:
    Different Colors for Neighbours: Two neighboring countries cannot have the same color. This can be represented by iterating over the edges in the graph and for each pair of neighboring countries (i, j), add a constraint that the colors assigned to country i and country j must be different. This can be represented as:
    For each edge (i, j) in the graph:
    colors[i] â‰  colors[j]

Objective:
    Minimize the number of colors used. This can be achieved by minimizing the maximum value in the 'colors' array, which represents the number of colors used.

    ]
}

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:
```json
{
    "selected_movies": [0 | 1]
}
```

where 0 or 1 is the binary value indicating whether the movie is selected or not, in the same order as the input.

For example, a valid JSON (but not the correct answer) would be:
```json
{
    "selected_movies": [1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
}
```

where the selected movies are Tarjan of the Jungle, The President's Algorist and Steiner's Tree.
Decision Variables:
    Define binary variables for each movie to represent whether the movie is selected (1) or not (0). The variable 'selected_movies' is an array of size equal to the number of movies (9 in this case).

Domains:
    selected_movies[i] âˆˆ {0, 1} for each movie i. The value 1 indicates that the movie is selected, and 0 indicates that it is not selected.

Constraints:
    Non-overlapping Shows: The intervals of selected movies should not overlap. This can be represented by iterating over the movies and for each pair of movies i and j, add a constraint that if both movies are selected, their intervals should not overlap. This can be represented as:
    For each pair of movies i and j:
    selected_movies[i] AND selected_movies[j] => (interval[i][1] <= interval[j][0] OR interval[j][1] <= interval[i][0])

Objective:
    Maximize the number of selected movies. This can be represented by adding a maximize objective to the model with the sum of the 'selected_movies' array as the objective.

Question: A bank van had several bags of coins, each containing either 16, 17, 23, 24, 39, or 40 coins (there are multiple bags of the same kind). While the van was parked on the street, thieves stole some bags. A total of 100 coins were lost. It is required to find how many bags were stolen for each type of coin bag.

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:
```json
{
  "bags": [int]
}
```
where `bags` is a list of integers, each representing the number of bags stolen for each type of coin bag. The order of the integers in the list should be the same as the order of the coin bags in the input list.

For example, if they stole 2 bags of 16 coins and 3 bags of 40 coins, the answer should be:
```json
{
  "bags": [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3]
}
```
Decision Variables:
    Bags Stolen: Define integer variables b1, b2, b3, b4, b5, b6 to represent the number of bags stolen for each type of coin bag [16, 17, 23, 24, 39, 40].

Domains:
    Each bag stolen variable has a domain determined by the maximum number of bags available for that type:
    b1 in [0, max_b1]
    b2 in [0, max_b2]
    b3 in [0, max_b3]
    b4 in [0, max_b4]
    b5 in [0, max_b5]
    b6 in [0, max_b6]

Constraints:
    Total Coins Lost: The sum of the products of each bags stolen and their corresponding number of coins per bag must equal the total number of coins lost, which is 100 coins. This is captured by the equation:
    16 * b1 + 17 * b2 + 23 * b3 + 24 * b4 + 39 * b5 + 40 * b6 = 100

Question: Out of the set of integers 1,...,100 you are given ten different integers ([81 21 79  4 29 70 28 20 14  7]). From this set A of ten integers you can always find two disjoint non-empty subsets, S and T, such that the sum of elements in S equals the sum of elements in T. Note: S union T does not need to be all ten elements of A. Find sets S and T for the given set A.

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:
```json
{
  "in_S": [0 | 1],
  "in_T": [0 | 1]
}
```
where in_S and in_T are arrays of 10 elements each. The elements of in_S and in_T should be 0 or 1, depending on whether the corresponding element of A is in S or T.

For example, if the answer is S = {81} and T = {21, 79}, the answer should be:
```json
{
  "in_S": [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  "in_T": [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
}
```
Decision Variables:
    Define binary variables for each element in the given set A to represent whether the element belongs to subset S (in_S) or subset T (in_T). The variables 'in_S' and 'in_T' are arrays of size 10.

Domains:
    in_S[i], in_T[i] âˆˆ {0, 1} for each element i in the given set A. The value 1 indicates that the element belongs to the corresponding subset, and 0 indicates that it does not.

Constraints:
    Disjoint Subsets: The subsets S and T must be disjoint, meaning no element can belong to both subsets. This can be represented as:
    in_S[i] + in_T[i] â‰¤ 1 for each element i in A.

    Sum Equality: The sum of elements in subset S must be equal to the sum of elements in subset T. This can be represented by iterating over all possible subsets S and T and adding a constraint that the sum of elements in S is equal to the sum of elements in T.

Question: In graph theory, an independent set is a set of vertices in a graph, no two of which are adjacent. A maximal independent set is an independent set that is not a subset of any other independent set. A graph may have many maximal independent sets of widely varying sizes: find the maximal independent sets for the data provided. The data provides an array containing for each node of the graph the set of adjacent nodes.

Here is the data:
{
    "n": 8,
    "adjacency_list": [  // indexing is 1-based
        [2, 3, 7],
        [1, 4, 8],
        [1, 4, 5],
        [2, 3, 6],
        [3, 6, 7],
        [4, 5, 8],
        [1, 5, 8],

    ]
}

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:
```json
{
    "nodes": [0 | 1]
}
```
where `nodes` is an array of 0s and 1s, where 1 indicates that the node is part of the maximal independent set and 0 indicates that it is not.

```json
{
    "nodes": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
}
```
Decision Variables:
    Define binary variables for each node to represent whether the node is part of the maximal independent set (1) or not (0). The variable 'nodes' is an array of size equal to the number of nodes (8 in this case).

Domains:
    nodes[i] âˆˆ {0, 1} for each node i. The value 1 indicates that the node is part of the maximal independent set, and 0 indicates that it is not.

Constraints:

Question: In preparation for Passover, five children at Hebrew school (Bernice, Carl, Debby, Sammy, and Ted) have been chosen to present different parts of the story of the Exodus from Egypt (burning bush, captivity, Mosesâ€™s youth, Passover, or the Ten Commandments). Each child is a different age (three, five, seven, eight, or ten), and the family of each child has recently made its own exodus to America from a different country (Ethiopia, Kazakhstan, Lithuania, Morocco, or Yemen). Can you find the age of each child, his or her familyâ€™s country of origin, and the part of the Exodus story each related?
1. Debbyâ€™s family is from Lithuania.
2. The child who told the story of the Passover is two years older than Bernice.
3. The child whose family is from Yemen is younger than the child from the Ethiopian family.
4. The child from the Moroccan family is three years older than Ted.
5. Sammy is three years older than the child who told the story of Mosesâ€™s youth in the house of the Pharaoh.
Determine the association: Age-Child-Country-Story.

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:
```json
{
    "ages": [int],
    "children": [int],
    "countries": [int],
    "stories": [int]
}
```
Where each list contains integers from 1 to 5 representing the mapping of the children to the ages, countries, and stories. The numbers should be in the same order as the entities in the question (alphabetical order).

For example, a valid JSON (but not the answer for the example above) would be:
```json
{
    "ages": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    "children": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    "countries": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    "stories": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
}
```
Decision Variables:
    Define integer variables for each child to represent their age, country of origin, and the part of the Exodus story they related. The variables 'ages', 'children', 'countries', and 'stories' are arrays of size 5.

Domains:
    Each variable has a domain of [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] representing the five children.

Constraints:
    1. Debby's family is from Lithuania:
    countries[Debby] = Lithuania

    2. The child who told the story of the Passover is two years older than Bernice:
    ages[Passover] = ages[Bernice] + 2

    3. The child whose family is from Yemen is younger than the child from the Ethiopian family:
    (countries[Yemen] == youngest(countries)) && (countries[Ethiopia] == oldest(countries))

    4. The child from the Moroccan family is three years older than Ted:
    ages[Morocco] = ages[Ted] + 3

    5. Sammy is three years older than the child who told the story of Moses's youth in the house of the Pharaoh:
    ages[Sammy] = ages[Moses] + 3

    All children, countries, ages, and stories are different:
    AllDifferent(ages)
    AllDifferent(children)
    AllDifferent(countries)
    AllDifferent(stories)

Question: There are 13 people. 4 of them are male. They randomly enter a room one at a time. Find a way that the males and females enter so that the ratio of females to males in the room at any one time is no greater than 7/3?

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:
```json
{
  "sequence": [0 | 1]
}
```
where 0 means a male enters the room, and 1 means a female enters the room.

For example a valid JSON (but not a valid answer) would be:
```json
{
  "sequence": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
}
```
Decision Variables:
    Define binary variables for each person to represent whether a male (0) or a female (1) enters the room. The variable 'sequence' is an array of size 13.

Domains:
    Each variable in the 'sequence' array has a domain of {0, 1} where 0 represents a male and 1 represents a female.

Constraints:
    Ratio Constraint: At any point in the sequence, the ratio of females to males in the room must not exceed 7/3. This can be represented by iterating over the sequence and adding a constraint that at each point, the sum of females divided by the sum of males up to that point must not exceed 7/3.

Objective:
    There is no objective function in this problem as we are not optimizing anything. We are simply finding a feasible sequence that satisfies the constraint.

Question: At the hospital n people are on a waiting list for a kidneyâ€™s transplant. We have the information about the compatibility between these people as a directed graph: compatible[i] is the set of people to which i can donate. Given this information, we want to maximize the number of people that receive a new kidney: anyone who gives a kidney must receive one, and no person receives more than one kidney. Use the following data:

{
    "num_people": 8,
    "compatible": [  // 1-based index
        [2, 3],
        [1, 6],
        [1, 4, 7],
        [2],
        [2],
        [5],
        [8],
        [3]
    ]
}

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:
```json
{
    "transplants": [[0 | 1]]
}
```

Where transplants[i][j] is 1 if person i gives a kidney to person j, and 0 otherwise.

For example, a valid JSON (but not the answer for the example above) would be:
```json
{
    "transplants": [
        [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
    ]
}
```
Decision Variables:
    Define binary variables for each pair of people to represent whether person i gives a kidney to person j (1) or not (0). The variable 'transplants' is a 2D array of size num_people x num_people.

Domains:
    transplants[i][j] âˆˆ {0, 1} for each pair of people i, j. The value 1 indicates that person i gives a kidney to person j, and 0 indicates that person i does not give a kidney to person j.

Constraints:
    Each person can only give one kidney and receive one kidney. This can be represented by adding constraints that ensure each row and each column of the 'transplants' matrix sums up to 1.

    Compatibility constraint: If person i gives a kidney to person j, then j must be in the compatible list of i. This can be represented by adding constraints that if transplants[i][j] is 1, then j must be in the compatible list of i.

Objective:
    Maximize the number of people that receive a new kidney, which is equivalent to maximizing the sum of the 'transplants' matrix. This can be represented by adding a maximize objective to the model with the sum of all elements in the 'transplants' matrix as the objective.

Question: A farmer has 25 cows numbered 1 to 25. number 1 cow gives 1kg milk, number 2 gives 2 kg... number and so on up to number 25 that gives 25 kg per day. The farmer has 5 sons and he wants to distribute his cows to them: 7 to the first, 6 to the second and so on down to 3 to the last, however, the total quantity of milk produced should be the same: how can he distribute the cows?

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:
```json
{
    "cow_assignments": [int]

Domains:
    Each variable in 'cow_assignments' has a domain of [0, 4] to represent the five sons.

Constraints:
    Total Milk Quantity: The total quantity of milk produced by each son should be the same. This can be represented by adding a constraint that the sum of the milk produced by the cows assigned to each son should be equal to the total milk produced by the cows, which is the sum of 1+2+...+25.

    Number of Cows Assigned: Each son should be assigned the specified number of cows. This can be represented by adding constraints that the number of cows assigned to each son should be 7, 6, 5, 4, and 3 respectively.

Question: A kid goes into a grocery store and buys four items. The cashier charges $7.11, the kid pays and is about to leave when the cashier calls the kid back, and says "Hold on, I multiplied the four items instead of adding them; Iâ€™ll try again; Hah, with adding them the price still comes to $7.11". What were the prices of the four items?

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:
```json
{
  "prices": [int]
}
```
where `prices` is a list of four integers representing the prices of the four items in cents.

For example, a valid JSON (but not the answer for the example above) would be:

Decision Variables:
    Define an array of integer variables named prices to represent the prices of the four items in cents.

Domains:
    Each price variable has a domain of [1, 711] cents as the total price is $7.11.

Constraints:
