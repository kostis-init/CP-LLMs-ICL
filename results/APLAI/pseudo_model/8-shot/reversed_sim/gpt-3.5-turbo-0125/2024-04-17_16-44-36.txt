Question: Baker, Cooper, Fletcher, Miller, and Smith live on the first five floors of an apartment house. Baker does not live on the fifth floor. Cooper does not live on the first floor. Fletcher does not live on either the fifth or the first floor. Miller lives on a higher floor than does Cooper. Smith does not live on a floor adjacent to Fletcher’. Fletcher does not live on a floor adjacent to Cooper’s. They all live on different floors. Find the floors where these people live.

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:

```json
{
    "B": int,
    "C": int,
    "F": int,
    "M": int,
    "S": int
}
```

For example, if Baker lives on the 2nd floor, Cooper on the 1st, Fletcher on the 5th, Miller on the 3rd, and Smith on the 4th, then the answer should be:
```json
{
    "B": 2,
    "C": 1,
    "F": 5,
    "M": 3,
    "S": 4
}
```

Decision Variables:
    Define integer variables B, C, F, M, S to represent the floor where Baker, Cooper, Fletcher, Miller, and Smith live, respectively.

Domains:
    Each variable has a domain of [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] representing the five floors of the apartment house.

Constraints:
    Baker does not live on the fifth floor: This can be represented as:
    B != 5

    Cooper does not live on the first floor: This can be represented as:
    C != 1

    Fletcher does not live on the fifth or first floor: This can be represented as:
    F != 5, F != 1

    Miller lives on a higher floor than Cooper: This can be represented as:
    M > C

    Smith does not live on a floor adjacent to Fletcher: This can be represented as:
    |S - F| > 1

    Fletcher does not live on a floor adjacent to Cooper: This can be represented as:
    |F - C| > 1

    All live on different floors: This can be represented by adding AllDifferent constraints for the variables B, C, F, M, S.

Objective:
    There is no objective function in this problem as we are not optimizing anything. We are simply finding a feasible solution that satisfies all the constraints.

Question: My bank card has a 4 digit pin, abcd. I use the following facts to help me
remember it:
• no two digits are the same
• the 2-digit number cd is 3 times the 2-digit number ab
• the 2-digit number da is 2 times the 2-digit number bc
What is my pin?

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:
```json
{
    "a": int,
    "b": int,
    "c": int,
    "d": int

Question: A boy wants to give an apple to a girl. To get to her, he has to pass through five gates, each with a guard. He bribes each guard with half of his apples, plus one. The boy does not have a knife, therefore he gives the guard an integer number of apples. After he’s given the apple to the girl, he has no apples left. How many did he have to begin with and in the process?

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:
```json
{
  "apples": [int]
}
```
where "apples" is an array of 6 integers, each representing the number of apples before each gate, plus the last element being the number of apples given to the girl.

For example, a valid JSON (not the answer) would be:
```json
{
    "apples": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
}
```


Decision Variables:
    Define an array of integer variables named apples to represent the number of apples the boy has before passing through each gate and the number of apples given to the girl.

Domains:
    Each variable in the 'apples' array has a domain of positive integers.

Constraints:
    The number of apples given to each guard is half of the remaining apples plus one. This can be represented by iterating over the 'apples' array and adding a constraint that the number of apples at index i is equal to half of the apples at index i-1 plus one.
    The boy has no apples left after giving the apple to the girl. This can be represented by adding a constraint that the last element in the 'apples' array is 0.

Objective:
    There is no specific objective in this problem as we are not asked to optimize anything. We are just looking for a feasible solution that satisfies the constraints.

Question: A magic square is an n x n grid (n != 2) such that each cell contains a different integer from 1 to n^2 and the sum of the integers in each row, column and diagonal is equal. Find a magic square for size 4, knowing that the sum of integers of each row, column and diagonal has to be equal to n(n^2+ 1)/2 (integer).

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:
```json
{
    "square": [[int]]
}

For example, a 3x3 magic square should be given as:
```json
{
    "square": [[2, 7, 6], [9, 5, 1], [4, 3, 8]]
}
```
This means that the first row of the square is [2, 7, 6], the second row is [9, 5, 1] and the third row is [4, 3, 8].
Decision Variables:
    Define a 2D array 'square' of size n x n to represent the magic square.

Domains:
    Each cell in the 'square' array has a domain of [1, n^2] as each cell should contain a different integer from 1 to n^2.

Constraints:
    Different Integers: All integers in the magic square should be different. This can be represented as:
    AllDifferent(flatten(square))

    Row Sums: The sum of integers in each row should be equal to n(n^2 + 1) / 2. This can be represented as:
    sum(square[i][j] for j in range(n)) == n * (n^2 + 1) / 2 for i in range(n)

    Column Sums: The sum of integers in each column should be equal to n(n^2 + 1) / 2. This can be represented as:
    sum(square[i][j] for i in range(n)) == n * (n^2 + 1) / 2 for j in range(n)

    Diagonal Sums: The sum of integers in each diagonal should be equal to n(n^2 + 1) / 2. This can be represented as:
    sum(square[i][i] for i in range(n)) == n * (n^2 + 1) / 2

Question: Following a robbery at Sparkles the Jeweller’s, Inspector Korner of the Yard interviewed six of the usual suspects. He knew that the getaway car had been barely big enough to hold two, so he reckoned that at least four of them were innocent - but which ones? He also supposed that the innocent ones would tell the truth, while the guilty one or ones would lie. What they actually said was:
- ARTIE: "It wasn't me."
- BILL: "Crackitt was in it up to his neck."
- CRACKITT: "No I wasn't."
- DODGY: "If Crackitt did it, Bill did it with him."
- EDGY: "Nobody did it alone."
- FINGERS: "That’s right: it was Artie and Dodgy together."
If the good inspector’s suppositions were correct, who is guilty?

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:
```json
{
    "artie": 0 | 1,
    "bill": 0 | 1,
    "crackitt": 0 | 1,
    "dodgy": 0 | 1,
    "edgy": 0 | 1,
    "fingers": 0 | 1
}
```

Where 0 means that the suspect is innocent and 1 means that the suspect is guilty.

For example, if the guilty suspect is Artie, Bill, and Crackitt, the answer should be:
```json
{
    "artie": 1,
    "bill": 1,
    "crackitt": 1,
    "dodgy": 0,
    "edgy": 0,
    "fingers": 0
}
```
Decision Variables:
    Define binary variables for each suspect to represent whether they are guilty (1) or innocent (0). The variables 'artie', 'bill', 'crackitt', 'dodgy', 'edgy', and 'fingers' are used to denote the guilt status of each suspect.

Domains:
    Each variable has a domain of {0, 1}, where 0 represents innocence and 1 represents guilt.

Constraints:
    Artie: If Artie is guilty, then he is lying. This can be represented as:
    artie ≠ "It wasn't me."

    Bill: If Bill is guilty, then he is lying. This can be represented as:
    bill ≠ "Crackitt was in it up to his neck."

    Crackitt: If Crackitt is guilty, then he is lying. This can be represented as:
    crackitt ≠ "No I wasn't."

    Dodgy: If Dodgy is guilty, then he is lying. This can be represented as:
    dodgy ≠ "If Crackitt did it, Bill did it with him."

    Edgy: If Edgy is guilty, then he is lying. This can be represented as:
    edgy ≠ "Nobody did it alone."

    Fingers: If Fingers is guilty, then he is lying. This can be represented as:
    fingers ≠ "That’s right: it was Artie and Dodgy together."

    At least four are innocent: At least four suspects must be innocent. This can be represented by adding a constraint that the sum of all guilt variables is less than or equal to 2.

Question: Alice has to give Bob change of 199 euros. She has 6 different types of coins of different value ([1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50]) and she has a certain number of coins of each value available ([20, 10, 15, 8, 4, 2]). How can the change be composed with the available coins minimizing the number of coins used?

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:
```json
{
    "coin_counts": [int]
}
```

For example, if she gives to Bob 1 coin of value 1 and 3 coins of value 25, then the answer should be:
```json
{
    "coin_counts": [1, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0]
}
```

Decision Variables:
    Define an array of integer variables named coin_counts to represent the number of coins used for each coin value [1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50].

Domains:
    Each coin count variable has a domain of [0, ∞] as there is no upper limit on the number of coins that can be used.

Constraints:
    Total Change: The sum of the products of each coin count and its corresponding coin value must equal the total change to be given, which is 199 euros. This is captured by the equation:
    1*coin_counts[0] + 2*coin_counts[1] + 5*coin_counts[2] + 10*coin_counts[3] + 25*coin_counts[4] + 50*coin_counts[5] = 199

Objective:
    Minimize the total number of coins used. This can be achieved by adding a minimize objective to the model with the sum of the 'coin_counts' array as the objective function.

Question: We want to assign a different colour to the following countries: Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Netherlands and Luxembourg.
Two neighbouring countries cannot have the same colour.
Read the data below with the graph representing the adjacency of the countries: each pair (i; j) means that country i is adjacent to country j.
You can use integers starting from 1 to represent the colours.
Find a colouring that minimizes the number of colours used.

Here is the data:
{
    "num_edges": 9,
    "graph": [
        [3, 1],
        [3, 6],
        [3, 4],
        [6, 4],
        [6, 1],
        [1, 5],
        [1, 4],
        [4, 5],
        [4, 2]
    ],
    "nodes": ["Belgium", "Denmark", "France", "Germany", "Netherlands", "Luxembourg"]
}

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:
```json
{
    "colors": [int]
}
```
where the list of integers represents the colours assigned to the countries in the order they are given in the input.

For example, a valid JSON (not the answer) would be:
```json
{
    "colors": [1, 2, 4, 2, 3, 5]
}
```

Decision Variables:
    Define integer variables for each country to represent the color assigned to that country. The variable 'colors' is an array of size equal to the number of countries (6 in this case).

Domains:
    colors[i] ∈ {1, 2, 3, ...} for each country i. Each integer represents a different color.

Constraints:
    Two neighboring countries cannot have the same color. This can be represented by iterating over the edges in the graph and for each edge (i, j), add a constraint that the colors assigned to countries i and j must be different.

Objective:
    Minimize the number of colors used. This can be achieved by minimizing the maximum value in the 'colors' array, which represents the number of colors used.

Question: A bank van had several bags of coins, each containing either 16, 17, 23, 24, 39, or 40 coins (there are multiple bags of the same kind). While the van was parked on the street, thieves stole some bags. A total of 100 coins were lost. It is required to find how many bags were stolen for each type of coin bag.

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:
```json
{
  "bags": [int]
}
```
where `bags` is a list of integers, each representing the number of bags stolen for each type of coin bag. The order of the integers in the list should be the same as the order of the coin bags in the input list.

For example, if they stole 2 bags of 16 coins and 3 bags of 40 coins, the answer should be:
```json
{
  "bags": [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3]
}
```
Decision Variables:
    Define integer variables for each type of coin bag to represent the number of bags stolen for each type. The variable 'bags' is an array of size equal to the number of different types of coin bags (6 in this case).

Domains:
    Each variable in 'bags' has a domain of [0, ∞] as the thieves could have stolen any number of bags for each type.

Constraints:
    Total Coins Lost: The total number of coins lost is 100. This can be represented by iterating over the types of coin bags and adding a constraint that the sum of the product of the number of bags stolen for each type and the number of coins in that type is equal to 100.

Objective:
    There is no objective function in this problem as we are not optimizing anything. We are simply finding a feasible solution that satisfies the constraints.

Question: Out of the set of integers 1,...,100 you are given ten different integers ([81 21 79  4 29 70 28 20 14  7]). From this set A of ten integers you can always find two disjoint non-empty subsets, S and T, such that the sum of elements in S equals the sum of elements in T. Note: S union T does not need to be all ten elements of A. Find sets S and T for the given set A.

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:
```json
{
  "in_S": [0 | 1],
  "in_T": [0 | 1]
}
```
where in_S and in_T are arrays of 10 elements each. The elements of in_S and in_T should be 0 or 1, depending on whether the corresponding element of A is in S or T.

For example, if the answer is S = {81} and T = {21, 79}, the answer should be:
```json
{
  "in_S": [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  "in_T": [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
}
```
Decision Variables:
    Define binary variables for each element in the given set A to represent whether the element belongs to set S (in_S) or set T (in_T). The variables 'in_S' and 'in_T' are arrays of size 10, corresponding to the 10 elements in the given set A.

Domains:
    in_S[i], in_T[i] ∈ {0, 1} for each element i in the set A. The value 1 indicates that the element is included in the corresponding set, and 0 indicates that it is not included.

Constraints:
    Disjoint Non-Empty Subsets: The subsets S and T must be disjoint and non-empty. This can be represented by adding a constraint that at least one element must be in S and at least one element must be in T:
    At least one element in S: sum(in_S) >= 1
    At least one element in T: sum(in_T) >= 1

    Sum Equality: The sum of elements in set S must be equal to the sum of elements in set T. This can be represented by adding a constraint that the sum of the products of each element and its corresponding binary variable in S must equal the sum of the products of each element and its corresponding binary variable in T:
    sum(in_S[i] * A[i]) = sum(in_T[i] * A[i])

Objective:
    There is no specific objective in this problem as we are not asked to optimize anything. We are looking for a feasible solution that satisfies the constraints.

Question: In graph theory, an independent set is a set of vertices in a graph, no two of which are adjacent. A maximal independent set is an independent set that is not a subset of any other independent set. A graph may have many maximal independent sets of widely varying sizes: find the maximal independent sets for the data provided. The data provides an array containing for each node of the graph the set of adjacent nodes.

Here is the data:
{
    "n": 8,
    "adjacency_list": [  // indexing is 1-based
        [2, 3, 7],

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:
```json

where `nodes` is an array of 0s and 1s, where 1 indicates that the node is part of the maximal independent set and 0 indicates that it is not.

For example, a valid JSON (but not the answer for the example above) would be:
```json
{

Domains:
    nodes[i] ∈ {0, 1} for each node i. The value 1 indicates that the node is part of the maximal independent set, and 0 indicates that it is not.

Constraints:
    Independent Set: No two adjacent nodes can both be part of the maximal independent set. This can be represented by iterating over the adjacency list and for each pair of adjacent nodes (i, j), add a constraint that if nodes i and j are both selected, then they cannot be part of the maximal independent set. This can be represented as:
    For each pair of adjacent nodes i, j:
    nodes[i] + nodes[j] <= 1

Question: In preparation for Passover, five children at Hebrew school (Bernice, Carl, Debby, Sammy, and Ted) have been chosen to present different parts of the story of the Exodus from Egypt (burning bush, captivity, Moses’s youth, Passover, or the Ten Commandments). Each child is a different age (three, five, seven, eight, or ten), and the family of each child has recently made its own exodus to America from a different country (Ethiopia, Kazakhstan, Lithuania, Morocco, or Yemen). Can you find the age of each child, his or her family’s country of origin, and the part of the Exodus story each related?
1. Debby’s family is from Lithuania.
2. The child who told the story of the Passover is two years older than Bernice.
3. The child whose family is from Yemen is younger than the child from the Ethiopian family.
4. The child from the Moroccan family is three years older than Ted.
5. Sammy is three years older than the child who told the story of Moses’s youth in the house of the Pharaoh.
Determine the association: Age-Child-Country-Story.

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:
```json
{
    "ages": [int],
    "children": [int],
    "countries": [int],
    "stories": [int]
}
```
Where each list contains integers from 1 to 5 representing the mapping of the children to the ages, countries, and stories. The numbers should be in the same order as the entities in the question (alphabetical order).

For example, a valid JSON (but not the answer for the example above) would be:
```json

    "children": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    "countries": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    "stories": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
}
```
Decision Variables:
    Define integer variables for the age, child, country, and story for each of the five children: Bernice, Carl, Debby, Sammy, and Ted.

Domains:
    Each variable has a domain of [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] representing the mapping of the children to the ages, countries, and stories.

Constraints:
    1. Debby’s family is from Lithuania:
    This can be represented as:
    Debby's country = Lithuania

    2. The child who told the story of the Passover is two years older than Bernice:
    This can be represented as:
    Passover child's age = Bernice's age + 2

    3. The child whose family is from Yemen is younger than the child from the Ethiopian family:
    This can be represented as:
    Yemen child's age < Ethiopian child's age

    4. The child from the Moroccan family is three years older than Ted:
    This can be represented as:
    Moroccan child's age = Ted's age + 3

    5. Sammy is three years older than the child who told the story of Moses’s youth in the house of the Pharaoh:
    This can be represented as:
    Sammy's age = Moses's youth child's age + 3

Objective:
    There is no objective function in this problem as we are not optimizing anything. We are simply finding a feasible solution that satisfies all the constraints.

Question: There are 13 people. 4 of them are male. They randomly enter a room one at a time. Find a way that the males and females enter so that the ratio of females to males in the room at any one time is no greater than 7/3?

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:
```json
{
  "sequence": [0 | 1]
}
```
where 0 means a male enters the room, and 1 means a female enters the room.

For example a valid JSON (but not a valid answer) would be:
```json
{
  "sequence": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
}
```
Decision Variables:
    Define binary variables for each person to represent whether a male (0) or a female (1) enters the room. The variable 'sequence' is an array of size 13.

Domains:
    Each variable in 'sequence' has a domain of {0, 1} where 0 represents a male and 1 represents a female.

Constraints:
    Ratio Constraint: At any point in the sequence, the ratio of females to males in the room should not exceed 7/3. This can be represented by iterating over the sequence and for each person, adding a constraint that the sum of females should not be more than 7/3 times the sum of males at that point in the sequence.

Objective:
    There is no objective function in this problem as we are not optimizing anything. We are simply looking for a feasible sequence that satisfies the constraints.

Question: At the hospital n people are on a waiting list for a kidney’s transplant. We have the information about the compatibility between these people as a directed graph: compatible[i] is the set of people to which i can donate. Given this information, we want to maximize the number of people that receive a new kidney: anyone who gives a kidney must receive one, and no person receives more than one kidney. Use the following data:

{
    "num_people": 8,
    "compatible": [  // 1-based index
        [2, 3],
        [1, 6],
        [1, 4, 7],
        [2],
        [2],
        [5],
        [8],
        [3]
    ]
}

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:
```json
{
    "transplants": [[0 | 1]]
}
```

Where transplants[i][j] is 1 if person i gives a kidney to person j, and 0 otherwise.

For example, a valid JSON (but not the answer for the example above) would be:
```json
{
    "transplants": [
        [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
    ]
}
```
Decision Variables:
    Define binary variables for each pair of people to represent whether person i gives a kidney to person j (1) or not (0). The variable 'transplants' is a 2D array of size num_people x num_people.

Domains:
    transplants[i][j] ∈ {0, 1} for each pair of people i, j. The value 1 indicates that person i gives a kidney to person j, and 0 indicates that person i does not give a kidney to person j.

Constraints:
    Each person can only give one kidney and receive one kidney. This can be represented by adding constraints that ensure each row and each column of the 'transplants' matrix sums up to at most 1.

    Compatibility constraint: If person i can donate to person j, then person i must receive from person j. This can be represented by adding constraints that if person i can donate to person j (i is in the compatible list of j), then transplants[i][j] = transplants[j][i].

Objective:
    Maximize the number of people that receive a new kidney, which is equivalent to maximizing the sum of the 'transplants' matrix. This can be represented by adding a maximize objective to the model with the sum of all elements in the 'transplants' matrix as the objective.

Question: A farmer has 25 cows numbered 1 to 25. number 1 cow gives 1kg milk, number 2 gives 2 kg... number and so on up to number 25 that gives 25 kg per day. The farmer has 5 sons and he wants to distribute his cows to them: 7 to the first, 6 to the second and so on down to 3 to the last, however, the total quantity of milk produced should be the same: how can he distribute the cows?

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:
```json
{
    "cow_assignments": [int]
}
```
where `cow_assignments` is a list of 25 integers (from 0 to 4) that maps the cow to the son.
Decision Variables:
    Define integer variables for each cow to represent the son to whom the cow is assigned. The variable 'cow_assignments' is an array of size 25.

Domains:
    Each variable in 'cow_assignments' has a domain of [0, 4] as there are 5 sons (0 to 4) to whom the cows can be assigned.

Constraints:
    Total Milk Quantity: The total quantity of milk produced by the cows assigned to each son should be the same. This can be represented by adding a constraint that the sum of the milk produced by the cows assigned to each son should be equal. This is calculated as the sum of the milk produced by cows 1 to 7 for son 1, cows 8 to 13 for son 2, and so on up to cows 19 to 25 for son 5.

Objective:
    There is no objective function in this problem as we are not optimizing anything. We are simply finding a feasible solution that satisfies all the constraints.

Question: A kid goes into a grocery store and buys four items. The cashier charges $7.11, the kid pays and is about to leave when the cashier calls the kid back, and says "Hold on, I multiplied the four items instead of adding them; I’ll try again; Hah, with adding them the price still comes to $7.11". What were the prices of the four items?

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:
```json
{
  "prices": [int]
}
```
where `prices` is a list of four integers representing the prices of the four items in cents.

For example, a valid JSON (but not the answer for the example above) would be:
```json

  "prices": [120, 210, 100, 123]
}
```
Decision Variables:
    Define an array of integer variables named prices to represent the prices of the four items in cents.

Domains:
    Each price variable has a domain of [1, 711] cents as the total price is $7.11, which is equivalent to 711 cents.

Constraints:
    Total Price: The sum of the prices of the four items must be equal to 711 cents. This is captured by the equation:
    prices[0] + prices[1] + prices[2] + prices[3] = 711
