Question: Baker, Cooper, Fletcher, Miller, and Smith live on the first five floors of an apartment house. Baker does not live on the fifth floor. Cooper does not live on the first floor. Fletcher does not live on either the fifth or the first floor. Miller lives on a higher floor than does Cooper. Smith does not live on a floor adjacent to Fletcherâ€™. Fletcher does not live on a floor adjacent to Cooperâ€™s. They all live on different floors. Find the floors where these people live.

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:

```json
{
    "B": int,
    "C": int,
    "F": int,
    "M": int,
    "S": int
}
```

For example, if Baker lives on the 2nd floor, Cooper on the 1st, Fletcher on the 5th, Miller on the 3rd, and Smith on the 4th, then the answer should be:
```json
{
    "B": 2,
    "C": 1,
    "F": 5,
    "M": 3,
    "S": 4
}
```

Decision Variables:
    Define integer variables B, C, F, M, S to represent the floor number where Baker, Cooper, Fletcher, Miller, and Smith live, respectively.

Domains:
    Each variable has a domain of [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] as they represent the floor numbers.

Constraints:
    Different Floors: All variables must be different as they all live on different floors. This can be represented as:
    AllDifferent([B, C, F, M, S])

    Baker's Floor: Baker does not live on the fifth floor. This can be represented as:
    B != 5

    Cooper's Floor: Cooper does not live on the first floor. This can be represented as:
    C != 1

    Fletcher's Floor: Fletcher does not live on either the fifth or the first floor. This can be represented as:

Question: My bank card has a 4 digit pin, abcd. I use the following facts to help me
remember it:
â€¢ no two digits are the same
â€¢ the 2-digit number cd is 3 times the 2-digit number ab
â€¢ the 2-digit number da is 2 times the 2-digit number bc
What is my pin?

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:
```json
{
    "a": int,
    "b": int,
    "c": int,
    "d": int
}
```

For example, if the pin is 1234, the answer should be:
```json
{
    "a": 1,
    "b": 2,
    "c": 3,
    "d": 4
}
```

Decision Variables:
    Define integer variables a, b, c, d to represent the digits of the 4-digit pin.

Domains:
    Each variable has a domain of [1, 9] as no two digits can be the same.

Constraints:
    No Repeated Digits: Ensure that no two digits are the same. This can be represented as:
    AllDifferent([a, b, c, d])

    Relationship between 2-digit numbers:
    - The 2-digit number cd is 3 times the 2-digit number ab. This can be represented as:
    10*c + d == 3*(10*a + b)

    - The 2-digit number da is 2 times the 2-digit number bc. This can be represented as:
    10*d + a == 2*(10*b + c)

Objective:
    There is no objective function in this problem as we are not optimizing anything. We are simply finding a feasible solution that satisfies all the constraints.

Question: A boy wants to give an apple to a girl. To get to her, he has to pass through five gates, each with a guard. He bribes each guard with half of his apples, plus one. The boy does not have a knife, therefore he gives the guard an integer number of apples. After heâ€™s given the apple to the girl, he has no apples left. How many did he have to begin with and in the process?

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:
```json
{
  "apples": [int]
}
```
where "apples" is an array of 6 integers, each representing the number of apples before each gate, plus the last element being the number of apples given to the girl.

For example, a valid JSON (not the answer) would be:
```json
{
    "apples": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
}
```


Decision Variables:
    Define an array of integer variables named apples to represent the number of apples the boy has before passing through each gate, plus the number of apples given to the girl. The variable 'apples' is an array of size 6.

Domains:
    Each variable in 'apples' has a domain of positive integers.

Constraints:
    Bribe Calculation: The boy bribes each guard with half of his apples, plus one. This can be represented as:
    apples[i+1] = 0.5 * apples[i] + 1 for each gate i.

    Total Apples: The boy has no apples left after giving the apple to the girl. This can be represented as:
    apples[5] = 0

Objective:
    There is no specific objective in this problem as we are not asked to maximize or minimize anything. We are just looking for a feasible solution that satisfies the constraints.

Question: A magic square is an n x n grid (n != 2) such that each cell contains a different integer from 1 to n^2 and the sum of the integers in each row, column and diagonal is equal. Find a magic square for size 4, knowing that the sum of integers of each row, column and diagonal has to be equal to n(n^2+ 1)/2 (integer).

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:
```json
{
    "square": [[int]]
}

For example, a 3x3 magic square should be given as:
```json
{
    "square": [[2, 7, 6], [9, 5, 1], [4, 3, 8]]
}
```
This means that the first row of the square is [2, 7, 6], the second row is [9, 5, 1] and the third row is [4, 3, 8].
Decision Variables:
    Define a 2D array of integer variables named square to represent the magic square.

Domains:
    Each cell in the square has a domain of [1, n^2] where n is the size of the magic square (4 in this case).

Constraints:
    All Different: All cells in the square must contain different integers from 1 to n^2. This can be represented by adding an AllDifferent constraint for all cells in the square.

    Row Sums: The sum of integers in each row must be equal to the magic sum. This can be represented by adding constraints for each row to ensure that the sum of integers in that row is equal to the magic sum.

    Column Sums: The sum of integers in each column must be equal to the magic sum. This can be represented by adding constraints for each column to ensure that the sum of integers in that column is equal to the magic sum.

    Diagonal Sums: The sum of integers in each diagonal must be equal to the magic sum. This can be represented by adding constraints for each diagonal to ensure that the sum of integers in that diagonal is equal to the magic sum.

Objective:
    There is no specific objective in this problem as we are not asked to maximize or minimize anything. We are just looking for a feasible solution that satisfies all the constraints.

Question: Following a robbery at Sparkles the Jewellerâ€™s, Inspector Korner of the Yard interviewed six of the usual suspects. He knew that the getaway car had been barely big enough to hold two, so he reckoned that at least four of them were innocent - but which ones? He also supposed that the innocent ones would tell the truth, while the guilty one or ones would lie. What they actually said was:
- ARTIE: "It wasn't me."
- BILL: "Crackitt was in it up to his neck."
- CRACKITT: "No I wasn't."
- DODGY: "If Crackitt did it, Bill did it with him."
- EDGY: "Nobody did it alone."
- FINGERS: "Thatâ€™s right: it was Artie and Dodgy together."
If the good inspectorâ€™s suppositions were correct, who is guilty?

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:
```json
{
    "artie": 0 | 1,
    "bill": 0 | 1,
    "crackitt": 0 | 1,
    "dodgy": 0 | 1,
    "edgy": 0 | 1,
    "fingers": 0 | 1
}
```

Where 0 means that the suspect is innocent and 1 means that the suspect is guilty.

For example, if the guilty suspect is Artie, Bill, and Crackitt, the answer should be:
```json
{
    "artie": 1,
    "bill": 1,
    "crackitt": 1,
    "dodgy": 0,
    "edgy": 0,
    "fingers": 0
}
```
Decision Variables:
    Define binary variables for each suspect to represent whether they are guilty (1) or innocent (0). The variables 'artie', 'bill', 'crackitt', 'dodgy', 'edgy', and 'fingers' are binary variables.

Domains:
    Each variable is binary: 0 for innocent and 1 for guilty.

Constraints:
    - Artie: If Artie is guilty, he would be lying. This can be represented as:
    artie == 1 => (bill + crackitt + dodgy + edgy + fingers >= 1)
    - Bill: If Bill is guilty, he would be lying. This can be represented as:
    bill == 1 => crackitt == 0
    - Crackitt: If Crackitt is guilty, he would be lying. This can be represented as:
    crackitt == 1 => crackitt == 0
    - Dodgy: If Dodgy is guilty, he would be lying. This can be represented as:
    dodgy == 1 => (crackitt + bill >= 1)
    - Edgy: If Edgy is guilty, he would be lying. This can be represented as:
    edgy == 1 => (artie + bill + crackitt + dodgy + fingers >= 1)
    - Fingers: If Fingers is guilty, he would be lying. This can be represented as:
    fingers == 1 => (artie + dodgy == 1)

Question: Alice has to give Bob change of 199 euros. She has 6 different types of coins of different value ([1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50]) and she has a certain number of coins of each value available ([20, 10, 15, 8, 4, 2]). How can the change be composed with the available coins minimizing the number of coins used?

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:
```json
{
    "coin_counts": [int]
}
```

For example, if she gives to Bob 1 coin of value 1 and 3 coins of value 25, then the answer should be:
```json
{
    "coin_counts": [1, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0]
}
```

Decision Variables:
    Define an array of integer variables named coin_counts to represent the number of coins used for each coin value [1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50].

Domains:
    Each coin count variable has a domain of [0, maximum number of coins available for that value]. The maximum number of coins available for each value is given as [20, 10, 15, 8, 4, 2].

Constraints:
    Total Change: The total change given to Bob must be 199 euros. This can be represented as:
    1*coin_counts[0] + 2*coin_counts[1] + 5*coin_counts[2] + 10*coin_counts[3] + 25*coin_counts[4] + 50*coin_counts[5] = 199

Objective:
    Minimize the number of coins used, which is equivalent to minimizing the sum of the 'coin_counts' array. This can be represented as adding a minimize objective to the model with the sum of 'coin_counts' as the objective function.

Question: We want to assign a different colour to the following countries: Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Netherlands and Luxembourg.
Two neighbouring countries cannot have the same colour.
Read the data below with the graph representing the adjacency of the countries: each pair (i; j) means that country i is adjacent to country j.
You can use integers starting from 1 to represent the colours.
Find a colouring that minimizes the number of colours used.

Here is the data:
{
    "num_edges": 9,
    "graph": [
        [3, 1],
        [3, 6],
        [3, 4],
        [6, 4],
        [6, 1],
        [1, 5],
        [1, 4],
        [4, 5],
        [4, 2]
    ],
    "nodes": ["Belgium", "Denmark", "France", "Germany", "Netherlands", "Luxembourg"]
}

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:
```json
{
    "colors": [int]
}
```
where the list of integers represents the colours assigned to the countries in the order they are given in the input.

For example, a valid JSON (not the answer) would be:
```json
{
    "colors": [1, 2, 4, 2, 3, 5]
}
```

Decision Variables:
    Define integer variables for each country to represent the color assigned to that country. The variable 'colors' is an array of size equal to the number of countries (6 in this case).

Domains:
    Each color variable has a domain of integers starting from 1, representing the different colors that can be assigned to the countries.

Constraints:
    Different Colors: Two neighboring countries cannot have the same color. This can be represented by iterating over the edges in the graph and adding a constraint that the colors of the connected countries must be different. This can be represented as:
    For each edge (i, j) in the graph:
    colors[i] != colors[j]

Objective:
    Minimize Number of Colors: Aim to minimize the total number of colors used. This can be achieved by minimizing the maximum color assigned to any country.

Question: A bank van had several bags of coins, each containing either 16, 17, 23, 24, 39, or 40 coins (there are multiple bags of the same kind). While the van was parked on the street, thieves stole some bags. A total of 100 coins were lost. It is required to find how many bags were stolen for each type of coin bag.

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:
```json
{
  "bags": [int]
}
```
where `bags` is a list of integers, each representing the number of bags stolen for each type of coin bag. The order of the integers in the list should be the same as the order of the coin bags in the input list.

For example, if they stole 2 bags of 16 coins and 3 bags of 40 coins, the answer should be:
```json
{
  "bags": [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3]
}
```
Decision Variables:
    Define integer variables for each type of coin bag to represent the number of bags stolen for that type. The variable 'bags' is an array of size equal to the number of different types of coin bags (6 in this case).

Domains:
    Each variable in 'bags' has a domain of [0, infinity] as the number of bags stolen can be any non-negative integer.

Constraints:
    Total Coins Lost: The total number of coins lost is 100. This can be represented as:
    16 * bags[0] + 17 * bags[1] + 23 * bags[2] + 24 * bags[3] + 39 * bags[4] + 40 * bags[5] = 100

Objective:
    There is no objective function in this problem as we are not optimizing anything. We are simply finding a feasible solution that satisfies all the constraints.

Question: Out of the set of integers 1,...,100 you are given ten different integers ([81 21 79  4 29 70 28 20 14  7]). From this set A of ten integers you can always find two disjoint non-empty subsets, S and T, such that the sum of elements in S equals the sum of elements in T. Note: S union T does not need to be all ten elements of A. Find sets S and T for the given set A.

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:
```json
{
  "in_S": [0 | 1],
  "in_T": [0 | 1]
}
```
where in_S and in_T are arrays of 10 elements each. The elements of in_S and in_T should be 0 or 1, depending on whether the corresponding element of A is in S or T.

For example, if the answer is S = {81} and T = {21, 79}, the answer should be:
```json
{
  "in_S": [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  "in_T": [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
}
```
Decision Variables:
    Define binary variables for each integer in the set A to represent whether the integer is in set S (in_S) or set T (in_T). The variables 'in_S' and 'in_T' are arrays of size equal to the number of integers in the set A (10 in this case).

Domains:
    in_S[i], in_T[i] âˆˆ {0, 1} for each integer i in the set A. The value 1 indicates that the integer is in set S or set T, and 0 indicates that it is not.

Constraints:
    Disjoint Subsets: The subsets S and T must be disjoint, meaning an integer cannot be in both sets. This can be represented as:
    in_S[i] + in_T[i] <= 1 for each integer i in the set A.

    Sum Equality: The sum of elements in set S must be equal to the sum of elements in set T. This can be represented by adding a constraint that the sum of (in_S[i] * A[i]) for all i in A is equal to the sum of (in_T[i] * A[i]) for all i in A.

    There is no objective function in this problem as we are not optimizing anything. We are simply finding a feasible solution that satisfies all the constraints.

Question: In graph theory, an independent set is a set of vertices in a graph, no two of which are adjacent. A maximal independent set is an independent set that is not a subset of any other independent set. A graph may have many maximal independent sets of widely varying sizes: find the maximal independent sets for the data provided. The data provides an array containing for each node of the graph the set of adjacent nodes.

Here is the data:
{
    "n": 8,
    "adjacency_list": [  // indexing is 1-based
        [2, 3, 7],
        [1, 4, 8],

        [4, 5, 8],
        [1, 5, 8],

    ]
}

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:
```json
{
    "nodes": [0 | 1]
}
```
where `nodes` is an array of 0s and 1s, where 1 indicates that the node is part of the maximal independent set and 0 indicates that it is not.

```json
{

```

    Define binary variables for each node to represent whether the node is part of the maximal independent set (1) or not (0). The variable 'nodes' is an array of size equal to the number of nodes (8 in this case).

Domains:
    nodes[i] âˆˆ {0, 1} for each node i. The value 1 indicates that the node is part of the maximal independent set, and 0 indicates that it is not.

Constraints:
    Independent Set: No two adjacent nodes can both be part of the maximal independent set. This can be represented by iterating over the adjacency list and for each pair of adjacent nodes (i, j), add a constraint that if nodes i and j are both selected, then they cannot be adjacent. This can be represented as:
    For each pair of adjacent nodes i, j:
    If j is adjacent to i, then nodes[i] + nodes[j] <= 1.

Objective:
    Maximize the number of nodes in the independent set. This can be represented by adding a maximize objective to the model with the sum of the 'nodes' array as the objective.

Question: In preparation for Passover, five children at Hebrew school (Bernice, Carl, Debby, Sammy, and Ted) have been chosen to present different parts of the story of the Exodus from Egypt (burning bush, captivity, Mosesâ€™s youth, Passover, or the Ten Commandments). Each child is a different age (three, five, seven, eight, or ten), and the family of each child has recently made its own exodus to America from a different country (Ethiopia, Kazakhstan, Lithuania, Morocco, or Yemen). Can you find the age of each child, his or her familyâ€™s country of origin, and the part of the Exodus story each related?
1. Debbyâ€™s family is from Lithuania.
2. The child who told the story of the Passover is two years older than Bernice.
3. The child whose family is from Yemen is younger than the child from the Ethiopian family.
4. The child from the Moroccan family is three years older than Ted.
5. Sammy is three years older than the child who told the story of Mosesâ€™s youth in the house of the Pharaoh.
Determine the association: Age-Child-Country-Story.

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:
```json
{
    "ages": [int],
    "children": [int],
    "countries": [int],
    "stories": [int]
}
```
Where each list contains integers from 1 to 5 representing the mapping of the children to the ages, countries, and stories. The numbers should be in the same order as the entities in the question (alphabetical order).

For example, a valid JSON (but not the answer for the example above) would be:
```json
{
    "ages": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    "children": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    "countries": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],

}
```
Decision Variables:
    Define integer variables for each entity (age, child, country, story) to represent the mapping of each child to their age, country, and story. The variables 'ages', 'children', 'countries', 'stories' are arrays of size 5.

Domains:
    Each variable has a domain of [1, 5] as there are five children, ages, countries, and stories.

Constraints:
    1. Debby's family is from Lithuania: This can be represented as countries[Debby] == Lithuania.
    2. The child who told the story of Passover is two years older than Bernice: This can be represented as ages[Passover] == ages[Bernice] + 2.
    3. The child from Yemen is younger than the child from the Ethiopian family: This can be represented as ages[Yemen] < ages[Ethiopia].
    4. The child from the Moroccan family is three years older than Ted: This can be represented as ages[Morocco] == ages[Ted] + 3.
    5. Sammy is three years older than the child who told the story of Moses's youth: This can be represented as ages[Sammy] == ages[Moses] + 3.

Objective:
    There is no objective function in this problem as we are not optimizing anything. We are simply finding a feasible solution that satisfies all the constraints.

Question: There are 13 people. 4 of them are male. They randomly enter a room one at a time. Find a way that the males and females enter so that the ratio of females to males in the room at any one time is no greater than 7/3?

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:
```json
{
  "sequence": [0 | 1]
}
```
where 0 means a male enters the room, and 1 means a female enters the room.

For example a valid JSON (but not a valid answer) would be:
```json
{
  "sequence": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
}
```
Decision Variables:
    Define binary variables for each person to represent whether a male (0) or a female (1) enters the room. The variable 'sequence' is an array of size equal to the number of people (13 in this case).

Domains:
    Each variable in 'sequence' has a domain of {0, 1} where 0 represents a male and 1 represents a female.

Constraints:
    Ratio Constraint: At any point in the sequence, the ratio of females to males in the room should not exceed 7/3. This can be represented by iterating over the sequence and for each person, checking the ratio of females to males in the room up to that point. If the ratio exceeds 7/3, add a constraint that the number of females should not exceed 7/3 times the number of males.

Objective:
    There is no objective function in this problem as we are not optimizing anything. We are simply finding a feasible sequence that satisfies the constraints.

Question: At the hospital n people are on a waiting list for a kidneyâ€™s transplant. We have the information about the compatibility between these people as a directed graph: compatible[i] is the set of people to which i can donate. Given this information, we want to maximize the number of people that receive a new kidney: anyone who gives a kidney must receive one, and no person receives more than one kidney. Use the following data:

{
    "num_people": 8,
    "compatible": [  // 1-based index
        [2, 3],
        [1, 6],
        [1, 4, 7],
        [2],
        [2],
        [5],
        [8],
        [3]
    ]
}

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:
```json
{
    "transplants": [[0 | 1]]
}
```

Where transplants[i][j] is 1 if person i gives a kidney to person j, and 0 otherwise.

For example, a valid JSON (but not the answer for the example above) would be:
```json
{
    "transplants": [
        [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

```
Decision Variables:
    Define binary variables for each pair of people to represent whether person i gives a kidney to person j. The variable 'transplants' is a 2D array of size n x n, where n is the number of people (8 in this case).

Domains:
    transplants[i][j] âˆˆ {0, 1} for each pair of people i, j. The value 1 indicates that person i gives a kidney to person j, and 0 indicates that person i does not give a kidney to person j.

Constraints:
    Compatibility: Anyone who gives a kidney must receive one. This can be represented by ensuring that if person i gives a kidney to person j, then person j must also give a kidney to person i. This can be represented as:
    transplants[i][j] == transplants[j][i]

    One Kidney per Person: No person receives more than one kidney. This can be represented by ensuring that each person can only give a kidney to at most one person. This can be represented as:
    For each person i, the sum of transplants[i] must be at most 1.

Objective:
    Maximize the number of people that receive a new kidney. This can be achieved by maximizing the sum of all transplants, which represents the total number of kidney transplants performed.

Question: A farmer has 25 cows numbered 1 to 25. number 1 cow gives 1kg milk, number 2 gives 2 kg... number and so on up to number 25 that gives 25 kg per day. The farmer has 5 sons and he wants to distribute his cows to them: 7 to the first, 6 to the second and so on down to 3 to the last, however, the total quantity of milk produced should be the same: how can he distribute the cows?

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:
```json
{
    "cow_assignments": [int]
}
```
where `cow_assignments` is a list of 25 integers (from 0 to 4) that maps the cow to the son.
Decision Variables:
    Define integer variables for each cow to represent which son the cow is assigned to. The variable 'cow_assignments' is an array of size 25, where each element represents the son to whom the cow is assigned.

Domains:
    cow_assignments[i] âˆˆ {0, 1, 2, 3, 4} for each cow i. The value 0 represents the first son, 1 represents the second son, and so on up to 4 representing the fifth son.

Constraints:
    Total Milk Quantity: The total quantity of milk produced by the cows assigned to each son should be the same. This can be represented by adding constraints that the sum of the milk produced by the cows assigned to each son should be equal. This can be represented as:
    Sum of milk produced by cows assigned to son 1 = Sum of milk produced by cows assigned to son 2 = ... = Sum of milk produced by cows assigned to son 5

Question: A kid goes into a grocery store and buys four items. The cashier charges $7.11, the kid pays and is about to leave when the cashier calls the kid back, and says "Hold on, I multiplied the four items instead of adding them; Iâ€™ll try again; Hah, with adding them the price still comes to $7.11". What were the prices of the four items?

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:
```json
{
  "prices": [int]
}
```
where `prices` is a list of four integers representing the prices of the four items in cents.

For example, a valid JSON (but not the answer for the example above) would be:
```json
{
  "prices": [120, 210, 100, 123]
}
```
Decision Variables:
    Define integer variables p1, p2, p3, p4 to represent the prices of the four items in cents.

Domains:
    Each price variable has a domain of [1, 711] cents as the total price is $7.11.

Constraints:
    Total Price: The sum of the prices of the four items must be equal to $7.11, which is 711 cents. This can be represented as:
    p1 + p2 + p3 + p4 = 711

    Multiplication Mistake: If the cashier mistakenly multiplied the prices instead of adding them, the total price would be different. This can be represented as:
    p1 * p2 * p3 * p4 != 711^2
