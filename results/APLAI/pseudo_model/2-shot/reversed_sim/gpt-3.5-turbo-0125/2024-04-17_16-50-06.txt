Question: Baker, Cooper, Fletcher, Miller, and Smith live on the first five floors of an apartment house. Baker does not live on the fifth floor. Cooper does not live on the first floor. Fletcher does not live on either the fifth or the first floor. Miller lives on a higher floor than does Cooper. Smith does not live on a floor adjacent to Fletcher’. Fletcher does not live on a floor adjacent to Cooper’s. They all live on different floors. Find the floors where these people live.

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:

```json
{
    "B": int,
    "C": int,
    "F": int,
    "M": int,
    "S": int
}
```

For example, if Baker lives on the 2nd floor, Cooper on the 1st, Fletcher on the 5th, Miller on the 3rd, and Smith on the 4th, then the answer should be:
```json
{
    "B": 2,
    "C": 1,
    "F": 5,
    "M": 3,
    "S": 4
}
```

Decision Variables:
    Define integer variables B, C, F, M, S to represent the floors where Baker, Cooper, Fletcher, Miller, and Smith live.

Domains:
    Each variable has a domain of [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] representing the five floors of the apartment house.

Constraints:
    Baker does not live on the fifth floor: This can be represented as B != 5.
    Cooper does not live on the first floor: This can be represented as C != 1.
    Fletcher does not live on the fifth or first floor: This can be represented as F != 5 and F != 1.
    Miller lives on a higher floor than Cooper: This can be represented as M > C.
    Smith does not live on a floor adjacent to Fletcher: This can be represented as |S - F| > 1.
    Fletcher does not live on a floor adjacent to Cooper: This can be represented as |F - C| > 1.
    All residents live on different floors: This can be represented as B != C, B != F, B != M, B != S, C != F, C != M, C != S, F != M, F != S, M != S.

Objective:
    There is no objective function in this problem as we are not optimizing anything. We are simply finding a feasible solution that satisfies all the constraints.

Question: My bank card has a 4 digit pin, abcd. I use the following facts to help me
remember it:
• no two digits are the same
• the 2-digit number cd is 3 times the 2-digit number ab
• the 2-digit number da is 2 times the 2-digit number bc
What is my pin?

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:
```json
{
    "a": int,
    "b": int,
    "c": int,
    "d": int
}
```

For example, if the pin is 1234, the answer should be:
```json
{
    "a": 1,
    "b": 2,
    "c": 3,
    "d": 4
}
```

Decision Variables:
    Define integer variables a, b, c, d to represent the four digits of the pin.

Domains:
    Each variable has a domain of [1, 9] as no two digits can be the same in a 4-digit pin.

Constraints:
    Different Digits: All digits in the pin must be different. This can be represented as:
    AllDifferent([a, b, c, d])

    Relationship between 2-digit numbers:
    - cd is 3 times ab: 10*c + d = 3*(10*a + b)
    - da is 2 times bc: 10*d + a = 2*(10*b + c)

Objective:
    There is no objective function in this problem as we are not optimizing anything. We are simply finding a feasible solution that satisfies all the constraints.

Question: A boy wants to give an apple to a girl. To get to her, he has to pass through five gates, each with a guard. He bribes each guard with half of his apples, plus one. The boy does not have a knife, therefore he gives the guard an integer number of apples. After he’s given the apple to the girl, he has no apples left. How many did he have to begin with and in the process?

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:
```json
{
  "apples": [int]
}
```
where "apples" is an array of 6 integers, each representing the number of apples before each gate, plus the last element being the number of apples given to the girl.

For example, a valid JSON (not the answer) would be:
```json
{
    "apples": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
}
```


Decision Variables:
    Define an array of integer variables named apples to represent the number of apples the boy has before passing through each gate and the number of apples given to the girl.

Domains:
    Each element in the 'apples' array has a domain of integers greater than or equal to 0.

Constraints:
    The number of apples after passing through each gate can be calculated based on the bribe given to the guard. The number of apples after passing through each gate is half of the apples before the gate plus one. This can be represented by the equation:
    apples[i+1] = (apples[i] / 2) + 1 for i in range(5)

    The number of apples given to the girl is the last element in the 'apples' array.

    The total number of apples the boy had initially is the number of apples given to the girl. This can be represented by the equation:
    sum(apples) = apples[5]

Objective:
    There is no specific objective in this problem as we are not asked to optimize anything. We are just looking for a feasible solution that satisfies the constraints.

Question: A magic square is an n x n grid (n != 2) such that each cell contains a different integer from 1 to n^2 and the sum of the integers in each row, column and diagonal is equal. Find a magic square for size 4, knowing that the sum of integers of each row, column and diagonal has to be equal to n(n^2+ 1)/2 (integer).

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:
```json
{
    "square": [[int]]
}

For example, a 3x3 magic square should be given as:
```json
{
    "square": [[2, 7, 6], [9, 5, 1], [4, 3, 8]]
}
```
This means that the first row of the square is [2, 7, 6], the second row is [9, 5, 1] and the third row is [4, 3, 8].
Decision Variables:
    Define a 2D array of integer variables named square to represent the magic square.

Domains:
    Each cell in the square has a domain of integers from 1 to n^2, where n is the size of the square (in this case, n=4).

Constraints:
    AllDifferent: All cells in the square must contain different integers from 1 to n^2.
    RowSum: The sum of integers in each row must be equal to n(n^2 + 1) / 2.
    ColumnSum: The sum of integers in each column must be equal to n(n^2 + 1) / 2.

Question: Following a robbery at Sparkles the Jeweller’s, Inspector Korner of the Yard interviewed six of the usual suspects. He knew that the getaway car had been barely big enough to hold two, so he reckoned that at least four of them were innocent - but which ones? He also supposed that the innocent ones would tell the truth, while the guilty one or ones would lie. What they actually said was:
- ARTIE: "It wasn't me."
- BILL: "Crackitt was in it up to his neck."
- CRACKITT: "No I wasn't."
- DODGY: "If Crackitt did it, Bill did it with him."
- EDGY: "Nobody did it alone."
- FINGERS: "That’s right: it was Artie and Dodgy together."
If the good inspector’s suppositions were correct, who is guilty?

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:
```json
{
    "artie": 0 | 1,
    "bill": 0 | 1,
    "crackitt": 0 | 1,
    "dodgy": 0 | 1,
    "edgy": 0 | 1,
    "fingers": 0 | 1
}
```

Where 0 means that the suspect is innocent and 1 means that the suspect is guilty.

For example, if the guilty suspect is Artie, Bill, and Crackitt, the answer should be:
```json
{
    "artie": 1,
    "bill": 1,
    "crackitt": 1,
    "dodgy": 0,
    "edgy": 0,
    "fingers": 0
}
```
Decision Variables:
    Define binary variables for each suspect to represent whether they are guilty (1) or innocent (0). Variables: artie, bill, crackitt, dodgy, edgy, fingers.

Constraints:
    - Artie: If Artie is guilty, then he is lying.
    - Bill: If Bill is guilty, then Crackitt is also guilty.
    - Crackitt: If Crackitt is guilty, then he is lying.
    - Dodgy: If Crackitt is guilty, then Bill is also guilty.
    - Edgy: If Edgy is guilty, then nobody did it alone, which means at least two suspects are guilty.
    - Fingers: If Fingers is guilty, then Artie and Dodgy are guilty together.

Objective:
    The objective is to find the guilty suspect(s) based on the statements provided by each suspect and the assumption that guilty suspects lie while innocent suspects tell the truth.

Question: Alice has to give Bob change of 199 euros. She has 6 different types of coins of different value ([1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50]) and she has a certain number of coins of each value available ([20, 10, 15, 8, 4, 2]). How can the change be composed with the available coins minimizing the number of coins used?

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:
```json
{
    "coin_counts": [int]
}
```

For example, if she gives to Bob 1 coin of value 1 and 3 coins of value 25, then the answer should be:
```json
{
    "coin_counts": [1, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0]
}
```

Decision Variables:
    Define an array of integer variables named coin_counts to represent the number of coins used for each type of coin [1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50].

Domains:
    Each coin count variable has a domain of [0, maximum number of coins available for that denomination]. In this case, the maximum number of coins available for each denomination is given as [20, 10, 15, 8, 4, 2].

Constraints:
    Total Change: The total change given to Bob must be 199 euros. This can be represented as the sum of the products of each coin count and its corresponding coin value:
    1*coin_counts[0] + 2*coin_counts[1] + 5*coin_counts[2] + 10*coin_counts[3] + 25*coin_counts[4] + 50*coin_counts[5] = 199

    Minimize Coins: The objective is to minimize the total number of coins used. This can be achieved by adding a constraint that the total number of coins used is minimized:
    coin_counts[0] + coin_counts[1] + coin_counts[2] + coin_counts[3] + coin_counts[4] + coin_counts[5]

Objective:
    Minimize the total number of coins used to give the change.

Solution:
    Solve the model and if a solution is found, print the solution in the specified format. The solution is a JSON object with a single key 'coin_counts' whose value is a list of integers representing the number of coins used for each type of coin.

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:
```json
{
    "colors": [int]
}
```
where the list of integers represents the colours assigned to the countries in the order they are given in the input.

For example, a valid JSON (not the answer) would be:
```json
{

}
```

Decision Variables:
    Define integer variables for each country to represent the color assigned to that country. The variable 'colors' is an array of size 6, one for each country.

Domains:
    colors[i] ∈ {1, 2, 3, ...} for each country i. Each integer represents a different color.

Constraints:
    Two neighboring countries cannot have the same color. This can be represented by iterating over the edges in the graph and adding a constraint that if two countries are adjacent, their colors must be different. This can be represented as:
    For each edge (i, j) in the graph:
    colors[i] ≠ colors[j].

Objective:
    Minimize the number of colors used. This can be represented by adding a minimize objective to the model with the maximum value in the 'colors' array as the objective.

    ]
}

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:
```json
{
    "selected_movies": [0 | 1]
}
```

where 0 or 1 is the binary value indicating whether the movie is selected or not, in the same order as the input.

For example, a valid JSON (but not the correct answer) would be:
```json
{
    "selected_movies": [1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
}
```

where the selected movies are Tarjan of the Jungle, The President's Algorist and Steiner's Tree.
Decision Variables:
    Define binary variables for each movie to represent whether the movie is selected (1) or not (0). The variable 'selected_movies' is an array of size equal to the number of movies (9 in this case).

Domains:
    selected_movies[i] ∈ {0, 1} for each movie i. The value 1 indicates that the movie is selected, and 0 indicates that it is not selected.

Constraints:
    Ensure that the selected movies do not overlap in their intervals. This can be represented by iterating over all pairs of movies and adding a constraint that if both movies are selected, their intervals should not overlap. This can be represented as:
    For each pair of movies i and j:
    selected_movies[i] AND selected_movies[j] => (interval_i_end <= interval_j_start OR interval_j_end <= interval_i_start).

Objective:
    Maximize the number of selected movies. This can be represented by adding a maximize objective to the model with the sum of the 'selected_movies' array as the objective.

Question: A bank van had several bags of coins, each containing either 16, 17, 23, 24, 39, or 40 coins (there are multiple bags of the same kind). While the van was parked on the street, thieves stole some bags. A total of 100 coins were lost. It is required to find how many bags were stolen for each type of coin bag.

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:
```json
{
  "bags": [int]
}
```
where `bags` is a list of integers, each representing the number of bags stolen for each type of coin bag. The order of the integers in the list should be the same as the order of the coin bags in the input list.

For example, if they stole 2 bags of 16 coins and 3 bags of 40 coins, the answer should be:
```json
{
  "bags": [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3]
}
```
Decision Variables:
    Bags Stolen: Define integer variables b1, b2, b3, b4, b5, b6 to represent the number of bags stolen for each type of coin bag [16, 17, 23, 24, 39, 40].

Domains:
    Each bag stolen variable has a domain of [0, ∞] as there can be any number of bags stolen for each type.

Constraints:
    Total Coins Lost: The total number of coins lost is 100. This can be represented by the equation:
    16 * b1 + 17 * b2 + 23 * b3 + 24 * b4 + 39 * b5 + 40 * b6 = 100

Question: Out of the set of integers 1,...,100 you are given ten different integers ([81 21 79  4 29 70 28 20 14  7]). From this set A of ten integers you can always find two disjoint non-empty subsets, S and T, such that the sum of elements in S equals the sum of elements in T. Note: S union T does not need to be all ten elements of A. Find sets S and T for the given set A.

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:
```json
{
  "in_S": [0 | 1],
  "in_T": [0 | 1]
}
```
where in_S and in_T are arrays of 10 elements each. The elements of in_S and in_T should be 0 or 1, depending on whether the corresponding element of A is in S or T.

For example, if the answer is S = {81} and T = {21, 79}, the answer should be:
```json
{
  "in_S": [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  "in_T": [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
}
```
Decision Variables:
    Define two arrays of binary variables, in_S and in_T, each of size 10 to represent whether the corresponding element of A belongs to set S or set T.

Domains:
    in_S[i], in_T[i] ∈ {0, 1} for each element i in A. The value 1 indicates that the element belongs to the corresponding set, and 0 indicates that it does not.

Constraints:
    1. Disjointness: Ensure that the elements are disjoint between sets S and T. This can be enforced by adding the constraint:
    in_S[i] + in_T[i] ≤ 1 for each element i in A.
    2. Sum Equality: The sum of elements in set S must be equal to the sum of elements in set T. This can be represented by the equation:
    sum(in_S[i] * A[i] for i in A) = sum(in_T[i] * A[i] for i in A).

    There is no specific objective in this problem as we are not asked to maximize or minimize anything. We are just looking for a feasible solution that satisfies the constraints.

Question: In graph theory, an independent set is a set of vertices in a graph, no two of which are adjacent. A maximal independent set is an independent set that is not a subset of any other independent set. A graph may have many maximal independent sets of widely varying sizes: find the maximal independent sets for the data provided. The data provides an array containing for each node of the graph the set of adjacent nodes.

Here is the data:
{
    "n": 8,
    "adjacency_list": [  // indexing is 1-based
        [2, 3, 7],
        [1, 4, 8],
        [1, 4, 5],
        [2, 3, 6],
        [3, 6, 7],
        [4, 5, 8],
        [1, 5, 8],
        [2, 6, 7]
    ]
}

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:
```json
{
    "nodes": [0 | 1]
}
```
where `nodes` is an array of 0s and 1s, where 1 indicates that the node is part of the maximal independent set and 0 indicates that it is not.

For example, a valid JSON (but not the answer for the example above) would be:
```json
{
    "nodes": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
}
```
Decision Variables:
    Define binary variables for each node to represent whether the node is part of the maximal independent set (1) or not (0). The variable 'nodes' is an array of size equal to the number of nodes (8 in this case).

Domains:
    nodes[i] ∈ {0, 1} for each node i. The value 1 indicates that the node is part of the maximal independent set, and 0 indicates that it is not.

Constraints:
    Independent Set: No two adjacent nodes can both be part of the maximal independent set. This can be represented by iterating over the adjacency list and for each pair of adjacent nodes (i, j), add a constraint that at most one of node i and node j can be part of the maximal independent set. This can be represented as:
    For each pair of adjacent nodes i, j:
    nodes[i] + nodes[j] <= 1.

Objective:
    Find the maximal independent set, which is represented by maximizing the sum of the 'nodes' array.

Question: In preparation for Passover, five children at Hebrew school (Bernice, Carl, Debby, Sammy, and Ted) have been chosen to present different parts of the story of the Exodus from Egypt (burning bush, captivity, Moses’s youth, Passover, or the Ten Commandments). Each child is a different age (three, five, seven, eight, or ten), and the family of each child has recently made its own exodus to America from a different country (Ethiopia, Kazakhstan, Lithuania, Morocco, or Yemen). Can you find the age of each child, his or her family’s country of origin, and the part of the Exodus story each related?
1. Debby’s family is from Lithuania.
2. The child who told the story of the Passover is two years older than Bernice.
3. The child whose family is from Yemen is younger than the child from the Ethiopian family.
4. The child from the Moroccan family is three years older than Ted.
5. Sammy is three years older than the child who told the story of Moses’s youth in the house of the Pharaoh.
Determine the association: Age-Child-Country-Story.

    ages[Passover] = ages[Bernice] + 2

    3. The child whose family is from Yemen is younger than the child from the Ethiopian family:
    (countries[Yemen] == youngest) && (countries[Ethiopia] == oldest)

    4. The child from the Moroccan family is three years older than Ted:

Question: There are 13 people. 4 of them are male. They randomly enter a room one at a time. Find a way that the males and females enter so that the ratio of females to males in the room at any one time is no greater than 7/3?

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:
```json
{
  "sequence": [0 | 1]
}
```
where 0 means a male enters the room, and 1 means a female enters the room.

For example a valid JSON (but not a valid answer) would be:
```json
{
  "sequence": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
}
```
BLUEPRINT:
Decision Variables:
    Define a binary array named sequence to represent the order in which people (males and females) enter the room. 0 represents a male entering, and 1 represents a female entering.

Domains:
    Each element in the sequence array has a domain of {0, 1}.

Constraints:
    Ratio Constraint: At any point in the sequence, the ratio of females to males in the room should not exceed 7/3. This can be enforced by maintaining a count of females and males in the room and ensuring that the ratio is always less than or equal to 7/3.

Objective:
    There is no specific objective in this problem as we are not asked to optimize anything. We are looking for a feasible sequence that satisfies the constraint.

Question: At the hospital n people are on a waiting list for a kidney’s transplant. We have the information about the compatibility between these people as a directed graph: compatible[i] is the set of people to which i can donate. Given this information, we want to maximize the number of people that receive a new kidney: anyone who gives a kidney must receive one, and no person receives more than one kidney. Use the following data:

{
    "num_people": 8,
    "compatible": [  // 1-based index
        [2, 3],
        [1, 6],
        [1, 4, 7],
        [2],
        [2],
        [5],
        [8],
        [3]
    ]
}

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:
```json
{
    "transplants": [[0 | 1]]
}
```

Where transplants[i][j] is 1 if person i gives a kidney to person j, and 0 otherwise.

For example, a valid JSON (but not the answer for the example above) would be:
```json
{
    "transplants": [
        [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

    ]
}
```
Decision Variables:
    Define binary variables for each pair of people to represent whether person i gives a kidney to person j (1) or not (0). The variable 'transplants' is a 2D array of size num_people x num_people.

Domains:
    transplants[i][j] ∈ {0, 1} for each pair of people i and j. The value 1 indicates that person i gives a kidney to person j, and 0 indicates that person i does not give a kidney to person j.

Constraints:
    Each person can only give one kidney and receive one kidney. This can be represented by adding constraints that ensure each row and each column of the 'transplants' matrix sums up to 1:
    For each person i:
    sum(transplants[i][j] for all j) = 1
    For each person j:
    sum(transplants[i][j] for all i) = 1

    The compatibility constraint: A person can only give a kidney to someone they are compatible with. This can be represented by adding constraints that ensure if person i gives a kidney to person j, then j must be in the compatible list of i:
    For each pair of people i and j:
    transplants[i][j] <= (j in compatible[i])

Objective:
    Maximize the number of people that receive a new kidney. This can be represented by adding a maximize objective to the model with the sum of the 'transplants' matrix as the objective.

Question: A farmer has 25 cows numbered 1 to 25. number 1 cow gives 1kg milk, number 2 gives 2 kg... number and so on up to number 25 that gives 25 kg per day. The farmer has 5 sons and he wants to distribute his cows to them: 7 to the first, 6 to the second and so on down to 3 to the last, however, the total quantity of milk produced should be the same: how can he distribute the cows?

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:
```json
{
    "cow_assignments": [int]
}
```
where `cow_assignments` is a list of 25 integers (from 0 to 4) that maps the cow to the son.
Decision Variables:
    Define an array of integer variables named cow_assignments to represent the assignment of each cow to a son. The array has 25 elements, each element ranging from 0 to 4 representing the 5 sons.

Domains:
    Each variable in cow_assignments has a domain of [0, 4] as there are 5 sons to distribute the cows to.

Constraints:
    Total Milk Quantity: The total milk produced by the cows assigned to each son should be the same. This can be represented by summing the milk produced by the cows assigned to each son and ensuring that the total is equal for all sons.

    Number of Cows per Son: The farmer wants to distribute 7 cows to the first son, 6 to the second, and so on down to 3 to the last son. This can be enforced by counting the number of cows assigned to each son and ensuring it matches the desired number.

Question: A kid goes into a grocery store and buys four items. The cashier charges $7.11, the kid pays and is about to leave when the cashier calls the kid back, and says "Hold on, I multiplied the four items instead of adding them; I’ll try again; Hah, with adding them the price still comes to $7.11". What were the prices of the four items?

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:
```json
{
  "prices": [int]
}
```
where `prices` is a list of four integers representing the prices of the four items in cents.

For example, a valid JSON (but not the answer for the example above) would be:
```json
{
  "prices": [120, 210, 100, 123]
}
```
This problem can be modeled as a constraint satisfaction problem with the following pseudo-model:

Decision Variables:
    Prices: Define an array of integer variables named prices to represent the prices of the four items in cents.

Domains:
    Each price variable has a domain of [1, 711] cents as the total price is $7.11, which is equivalent to 711 cents.

Constraints:
    Sum Constraint: The sum of the prices of the four items must be equal to 711 cents:
    prices[0] + prices[1] + prices[2] + prices[3] = 711

    Product Constraint: The product of the prices of the four items must also be equal to 711 cents:
    prices[0] * prices[1] * prices[2] * prices[3] = 711^2

Objective:
    There is no specific objective in this problem as we are not asked to maximize or minimize anything. We are looking for a feasible solution that satisfies both constraints.
