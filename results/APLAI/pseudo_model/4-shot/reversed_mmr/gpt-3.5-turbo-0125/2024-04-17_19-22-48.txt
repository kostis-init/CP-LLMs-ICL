Question: Baker, Cooper, Fletcher, Miller, and Smith live on the first five floors of an apartment house. Baker does not live on the fifth floor. Cooper does not live on the first floor. Fletcher does not live on either the fifth or the first floor. Miller lives on a higher floor than does Cooper. Smith does not live on a floor adjacent to Fletcherâ€™. Fletcher does not live on a floor adjacent to Cooperâ€™s. They all live on different floors. Find the floors where these people live.

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:

```json
{
    "B": int,
    "C": int,
    "F": int,
    "M": int,
    "S": int
}
```

For example, if Baker lives on the 2nd floor, Cooper on the 1st, Fletcher on the 5th, Miller on the 3rd, and Smith on the 4th, then the answer should be:
```json
{
    "B": 2,
    "C": 1,
    "F": 5,
    "M": 3,
    "S": 4
}
```

Decision Variables:
    Define integer variables B, C, F, M, S to represent the floor where Baker, Cooper, Fletcher, Miller, and Smith live, respectively.

Domains:
    Each variable has a domain of {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} representing the five floors of the apartment house.

Constraints:
    - Baker does not live on the fifth floor: B != 5
    - Cooper does not live on the first floor: C != 1
    - Fletcher does not live on either the fifth or the first floor: F != 5, F != 1
    - Miller lives on a higher floor than Cooper: M > C
    - Smith does not live on a floor adjacent to Fletcher: |S - F| != 1
    - Fletcher does not live on a floor adjacent to Cooper: |F - C| != 1
    - All live on different floors: B != C, B != F, B != M, B != S, C != F, C != M, C != S, F != M, F != S, M != S

Objective:
    There is no objective function in this problem as we are not optimizing anything. We are simply finding a feasible solution that satisfies all the constraints.

Question: A boy wants to give an apple to a girl. To get to her, he has to pass through five gates, each with a guard. He bribes each guard with half of his apples, plus one. The boy does not have a knife, therefore he gives the guard an integer number of apples. After heâ€™s given the apple to the girl, he has no apples left. How many did he have to begin with and in the process?

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:
```json
{
  "apples": [int]
}
```
where "apples" is an array of 6 integers, each representing the number of apples before each gate, plus the last element being the number of apples given to the girl.

For example, a valid JSON (not the answer) would be:
```json
{
    "apples": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
}
```


Decision Variables:
    Define an array of integer variables named apples to represent the number of apples the boy has before passing through each gate, plus the number of apples given to the girl. The array 'apples' has a size of 6.

Domains:
    Each variable in the 'apples' array has a domain of non-negative integers.

Constraints:
    The boy gives half of his apples plus one to each guard: This can be represented by the equation:
    apples[i+1] = (apples[i]/2) + 1 for all i in [0, 4]

    The boy has no apples left after giving the last apple to the girl: This can be represented by the equation:
    apples[5] = 0

Objective:
    There is no specific objective in this problem as we are not asked to optimize anything. We are looking for a feasible solution that satisfies the constraints.

Question: A magic square is an n x n grid (n != 2) such that each cell contains a different integer from 1 to n^2 and the sum of the integers in each row, column and diagonal is equal. Find a magic square for size 4, knowing that the sum of integers of each row, column and diagonal has to be equal to n(n^2+ 1)/2 (integer).

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:
```json
{
    "square": [[int]]
}

For example, a 3x3 magic square should be given as:
```json
{
    "square": [[2, 7, 6], [9, 5, 1], [4, 3, 8]]
}
```
This means that the first row of the square is [2, 7, 6], the second row is [9, 5, 1] and the third row is [4, 3, 8].
Decision Variables:
    Define a 2D array 'square' of size n x n to represent the magic square.

Domains:
    Each cell in the square has a domain of integers from 1 to n^2, where n is the size of the magic square (4 in this case).

Constraints:
    All Different: All integers in the square must be different. This can be represented as:
    AllDifferent(flatten(square))

    Row Sums: The sum of integers in each row must be equal to the magic sum. This can be represented by adding constraints for each row to ensure the sum is equal to n(n^2 + 1) / 2.

    Column Sums: The sum of integers in each column must be equal to the magic sum. This can be represented by adding constraints for each column to ensure the sum is equal to n(n^2 + 1) / 2.

    Diagonal Sums: The sum of integers in each diagonal must be equal to the magic sum. This can be represented by adding constraints for the two diagonals to ensure the sum is equal to n(n^2 + 1) / 2.

Objective:
    There is no objective function in this problem as we are not optimizing anything. We are simply finding a feasible solution that satisfies all the constraints.

Question: Following a robbery at Sparkles the Jewellerâ€™s, Inspector Korner of the Yard interviewed six of the usual suspects. He knew that the getaway car had been barely big enough to hold two, so he reckoned that at least four of them were innocent - but which ones? He also supposed that the innocent ones would tell the truth, while the guilty one or ones would lie. What they actually said was:
- ARTIE: "It wasn't me."
- BILL: "Crackitt was in it up to his neck."
- CRACKITT: "No I wasn't."
- DODGY: "If Crackitt did it, Bill did it with him."
- EDGY: "Nobody did it alone."
- FINGERS: "Thatâ€™s right: it was Artie and Dodgy together."
If the good inspectorâ€™s suppositions were correct, who is guilty?

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:
```json
{
    "artie": 0 | 1,
    "bill": 0 | 1,
    "crackitt": 0 | 1,
    "dodgy": 0 | 1,
    "edgy": 0 | 1,
    "fingers": 0 | 1
}
```

Where 0 means that the suspect is innocent and 1 means that the suspect is guilty.

For example, if the guilty suspect is Artie, Bill, and Crackitt, the answer should be:
```json
{
    "artie": 1,
    "bill": 1,
    "crackitt": 1,
    "dodgy": 0,
    "edgy": 0,
    "fingers": 0
}
```
Decision Variables:
    Define binary variables for each suspect to represent whether they are guilty (1) or innocent (0). The variables are artie, bill, crackitt, dodgy, edgy, and fingers.

Domains:
    Each binary variable has a domain of {0, 1} where 0 represents innocent and 1 represents guilty.

Constraints:
    1. Artie: "It wasn't me." - This implies that Artie is innocent if he tells the truth.
    2. Bill: "Crackitt was in it up to his neck." - This implies that Bill is guilty if he accuses Crackitt.
    3. Crackitt: "No I wasn't." - This implies that Crackitt is innocent if he denies his involvement.
    4. Dodgy: "If Crackitt did it, Bill did it with him." - This implies that Dodgy is guilty if he accuses Bill when Crackitt is guilty.
    5. Edgy: "Nobody did it alone." - This implies that Edgy is guilty if he claims that nobody acted alone.
    6. Fingers: "Thatâ€™s right: it was Artie and Dodgy together." - This implies that Fingers is guilty if he confirms that Artie and Dodgy acted together.

Objective:
    There is no objective function in this problem as we are not optimizing anything. We are simply looking for a feasible solution that satisfies all the constraints to determine the guilty suspect.

Question: Alice has to give Bob change of 199 euros. She has 6 different types of coins of different value ([1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50]) and she has a certain number of coins of each value available ([20, 10, 15, 8, 4, 2]). How can the change be composed with the available coins minimizing the number of coins used?

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:
```json
{
    "coin_counts": [int]
}
```

For example, if she gives to Bob 1 coin of value 1 and 3 coins of value 25, then the answer should be:
```json
{
    "coin_counts": [1, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0]
}
```

Decision Variables:
    Define an array of integer variables named coin_counts to represent the number of coins used for each type of coin [1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50].

Domains:
    Each coin count variable has a domain of [0, maximum number of coins available for that denomination]. The maximum number of coins available for each denomination is given as [20, 10, 15, 8, 4, 2].

Constraints:
    Total Change: The sum of the products of each coin count and its corresponding coin value must equal the total change needed, which is 199 euros. This is captured by the equation:
    1*coin_counts[0] + 2*coin_counts[1] + 5*coin_counts[2] + 10*coin_counts[3] + 25*coin_counts[4] + 50*coin_counts[5] = 199

Objective:
    Minimize the total number of coins used, which is equivalent to minimizing the sum of the coin_counts array.

{
    "colors": [int]
}
```
where the list of integers represents the colours assigned to the countries in the order they are given in the input.

For example, a valid JSON (not the answer) would be:
```json
{
    "colors": [1, 2, 4, 2, 3, 5]
}
```

Decision Variables:
    Define integer variables for each country to represent the color assigned to that country. The variable 'colors' is an array of size 6.

Domains:
    colors[i] âˆˆ {1, 2, 3, ...} for each country i. Each integer represents a different color.

Constraints:
    Two neighbouring countries cannot have the same color. This can be represented by iterating over the edges in the graph and adding a constraint that if two countries are adjacent, their colors must be different. This can be represented as:
    For each edge (i, j) in the graph:
    colors[i] â‰ colors[j]

Objective:
    Minimize the number of colors used. This can be achieved by minimizing the maximum value in the 'colors' array.

Question: A bank van had several bags of coins, each containing either 16, 17, 23, 24, 39, or 40 coins (there are multiple bags of the same kind). While the van was parked on the street, thieves stole some bags. A total of 100 coins were lost. It is required to find how many bags were stolen for each type of coin bag.

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:
```json
{
  "bags": [int]
}
```
where `bags` is a list of integers, each representing the number of bags stolen for each type of coin bag. The order of the integers in the list should be the same as the order of the coin bags in the input list.

For example, if they stole 2 bags of 16 coins and 3 bags of 40 coins, the answer should be:
```json
{
  "bags": [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3]
}
```
Decision Variables:
    Bags Stolen: Define integer variables b1, b2, b3, b4, b5, b6 to represent the number of bags stolen for each type of coin bag [16, 17, 23, 24, 39, 40].

Domains:
    Each bags stolen variable has a domain determined by the maximum number of bags available for that type:
    b1 in [0, max_b1]
    b2 in [0, max_b2]
    b3 in [0, max_b3]
    b4 in [0, max_b4]
    b5 in [0, max_b5]
    b6 in [0, max_b6]

Constraints:
    Total Coins Lost: The sum of the products of each bags stolen and its corresponding number of coins per bag must equal the total number of coins lost, which is 100 coins. This is captured by the equation:
    16 * b1 + 17 * b2 + 23 * b3 + 24 * b4 + 39 * b5 + 40 * b6 = 100

Objective:
    There is no objective function in this problem as we are not optimizing anything. We are simply finding a feasible solution that satisfies all the constraints.

Question: Out of the set of integers 1,...,100 you are given ten different integers ([81 21 79  4 29 70 28 20 14  7]). From this set A of ten integers you can always find two disjoint non-empty subsets, S and T, such that the sum of elements in S equals the sum of elements in T. Note: S union T does not need to be all ten elements of A. Find sets S and T for the given set A.

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:
```json
{
  "in_S": [0 | 1],
  "in_T": [0 | 1]
}
```
where in_S and in_T are arrays of 10 elements each. The elements of in_S and in_T should be 0 or 1, depending on whether the corresponding element of A is in S or T.

For example, if the answer is S = {81} and T = {21, 79}, the answer should be:
```json
{
  "in_S": [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  "in_T": [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
}
```
Decision Variables:
    Define two arrays of binary variables in_S and in_T, each of size 10, to represent whether the corresponding element of A belongs to set S or set T.

Domains:
    in_S[i], in_T[i] âˆˆ {0, 1} for each element i in A.

Constraints:
    Disjoint Subsets: The subsets S and T must be disjoint, meaning no element can belong to both sets. This can be represented as:
    in_S[i] + in_T[i] â‰¤ 1 for each element i in A.

    Sum Equality: The sum of elements in set S must equal the sum of elements in set T. This can be represented as:
    sum(in_S[i] * A[i] for i in A) = sum(in_T[i] * A[i] for i in A)

Objective:
    There is no specific objective in this problem as we are not asked to maximize or minimize anything. We are just looking for a feasible solution that satisfies the constraints.

Question: In graph theory, an independent set is a set of vertices in a graph, no two of which are adjacent. A maximal independent set is an independent set that is not a subset of any other independent set. A graph may have many maximal independent sets of widely varying sizes: find the maximal independent sets for the data provided. The data provides an array containing for each node of the graph the set of adjacent nodes.

Here is the data:
{
    "n": 8,
    "adjacency_list": [  // indexing is 1-based
        [2, 3, 7],
        [1, 4, 8],
        [1, 4, 5],
        [2, 3, 6],
        [3, 6, 7],
        [4, 5, 8],
        [1, 5, 8],
        [2, 6, 7]
    ]
}

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:
```json
{
    "nodes": [0 | 1]
}
```
where `nodes` is an array of 0s and 1s, where 1 indicates that the node is part of the maximal independent set and 0 indicates that it is not.

For example, a valid JSON (but not the answer for the example above) would be:
```json
{
    "nodes": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
}
```
Decision Variables:
    Define binary variables for each node to represent whether the node is part of the maximal independent set (1) or not (0). The variable 'nodes' is an array of size equal to the number of nodes (8 in this case).

Domains:
    nodes[i] âˆˆ {0, 1} for each node i. The value 1 indicates that the node is part of the maximal independent set, and 0 indicates that it is not.

Constraints:
    Independent Set: No two adjacent nodes can both be part of the maximal independent set. This can be represented by iterating over the adjacency list and for each node i and its adjacent nodes, add a constraint that if node j is adjacent to node i, then nodes[i] + nodes[j] â‰¤ 1.

Objective:
    Find the maximal independent set, which is already defined by the constraints. The objective is to find a feasible solution that satisfies the constraints.

Question: In preparation for Passover, five children at Hebrew school (Bernice, Carl, Debby, Sammy, and Ted) have been chosen to present different parts of the story of the Exodus from Egypt (burning bush, captivity, Mosesâ€™s youth, Passover, or the Ten Commandments). Each child is a different age (three, five, seven, eight, or ten), and the family of each child has recently made its own exodus to America from a different country (Ethiopia, Kazakhstan, Lithuania, Morocco, or Yemen). Can you find the age of each child, his or her familyâ€™s country of origin, and the part of the Exodus story each related?
1. Debbyâ€™s family is from Lithuania.
2. The child who told the story of the Passover is two years older than Bernice.
3. The child whose family is from Yemen is younger than the child from the Ethiopian family.
4. The child from the Moroccan family is three years older than Ted.
5. Sammy is three years older than the child who told the story of Mosesâ€™s youth in the house of the Pharaoh.
Determine the association: Age-Child-Country-Story.

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:
```json

    countries[Ethiopia_child] = Ethiopia
    countries[Yemen_child] = Yemen
    ages[Yemen_child] < ages[Ethiopia_child]

    4. The child from the Moroccan family is three years older than Ted:

Question: There are 13 people. 4 of them are male. They randomly enter a room one at a time. Find a way that the males and females enter so that the ratio of females to males in the room at any one time is no greater than 7/3?

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:
```json
{
  "sequence": [0 | 1]
}
```
where 0 means a male enters the room, and 1 means a female enters the room.

For example a valid JSON (but not a valid answer) would be:
```json
{
  "sequence": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
}
```
Decision Variables:
    Define binary variables for each person to represent whether a male (0) or a female (1) enters the room. The variable 'sequence' is an array of size equal to the total number of people (13 in this case).

Constraints:
    Ratio Constraint: At any point in the sequence, the ratio of females to males in the room should not be greater than 7/3. This can be represented by iterating over the sequence and for each person, adding a constraint that the sum of females in the room should not be greater than 7/3 times the sum of males in the room.

Objective:
    There is no objective function in this problem as we are not optimizing anything. We are simply finding a feasible sequence that satisfies all the constraints.

Question: At the hospital n people are on a waiting list for a kidneyâ€™s transplant. We have the information about the compatibility between these people as a directed graph: compatible[i] is the set of people to which i can donate. Given this information, we want to maximize the number of people that receive a new kidney: anyone who gives a kidney must receive one, and no person receives more than one kidney. Use the following data:

{
    "num_people": 8,
    "compatible": [  // 1-based index
        [2, 3],
        [1, 6],
        [1, 4, 7],
        [2],
        [2],
        [5],
        [8],
        [3]
    ]
}

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:
```json
{
    "transplants": [[0 | 1]]
}
```

Where transplants[i][j] is 1 if person i gives a kidney to person j, and 0 otherwise.

For example, a valid JSON (but not the answer for the example above) would be:
```json
{
    "transplants": [
        [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
    ]
}
```
Decision Variables:
    Define a 2D array of binary variables transplants[i][j] to represent whether person i gives a kidney to person j. The variable 'transplants' is a matrix of size num_people x num_people.

Domains:
    transplants[i][j] âˆˆ {0, 1} for each pair of people i and j. The value 1 indicates that person i gives a kidney to person j, and 0 indicates that person i does not give a kidney to person j.

Constraints:
    Each person can only give or receive one kidney. This can be represented by adding constraints that ensure each person i can only donate to one person j and receive from one person j:
    For each person i:
    sum(transplants[i]) = 1
    sum(transplants[j][i] for all j) = 1

    Compatibility constraint: If person i can donate to person j, then transplants[i][j] should be 1:
    For each person i and their compatible recipients j:
    If j is in compatible[i], then transplants[i][j] = 1

Objective:
    Maximize the number of people that receive a new kidney. This can be represented by adding a maximize objective to the model with the sum of the 'transplants' array as the objective.

Question: A farmer has 25 cows numbered 1 to 25. number 1 cow gives 1kg milk, number 2 gives 2 kg... number and so on up to number 25 that gives 25 kg per day. The farmer has 5 sons and he wants to distribute his cows to them: 7 to the first, 6 to the second and so on down to 3 to the last, however, the total quantity of milk produced should be the same: how can he distribute the cows?

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:
```json
{
    "cow_assignments": [int]
}
```
where `cow_assignments` is a list of 25 integers (from 0 to 4) that maps the cow to the son.
Decision Variables:
    Define an array of integer variables named cow_assignments to represent the assignment of each cow to a son. The variable 'cow_assignments' is an array of size 25.

Domains:
    Each variable in 'cow_assignments' has a domain of [0, 4] to represent the five sons.

Constraints:
    Total Milk Quantity: The total quantity of milk produced by each son should be the same. This can be represented by adding a constraint that the sum of the milk produced by the cows assigned to each son should be equal.
    Milk Quantity Constraint: The milk produced by each cow should be assigned according to its number. This can be represented by adding a constraint that the milk produced by cow i should be assigned to the son represented by cow_assignments[i].

Objective:
    There is no specific objective in this problem as we are not asked to optimize anything. We are looking for a feasible solution that satisfies the constraints.

Question: A kid goes into a grocery store and buys four items. The cashier charges $7.11, the kid pays and is about to leave when the cashier calls the kid back, and says "Hold on, I multiplied the four items instead of adding them; Iâ€™ll try again; Hah, with adding them the price still comes to $7.11". What were the prices of the four items?

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:
```json
{
  "prices": [int]
}
```
where `prices` is a list of four integers representing the prices of the four items in cents.

For example, a valid JSON (but not the answer for the example above) would be:
```json
{
  "prices": [120, 210, 100, 123]
}
```
Decision Variables:
    Define an array of integer variables named prices to represent the prices of the four items in cents.

Domains:
    Each price variable has a domain of [1, 711] as the total price is $7.11, which is equivalent to 711 cents.

Constraints:
    Total Price: The sum of the prices of the four items must be equal to $7.11, which is 711 cents. This can be represented as:
    Sum(prices) = 711

    Multiplication Mistake: If the cashier mistakenly multiplied the prices instead of adding them, the total price would be much higher. This can be represented as:
    prices[0] * prices[1] * prices[2] * prices[3] != 711^2

    Addition Correction: When the prices are added correctly, the total price is $7.11, which is 711 cents. This can be represented as:
    prices[0] + prices[1] + prices[2] + prices[3] = 711
