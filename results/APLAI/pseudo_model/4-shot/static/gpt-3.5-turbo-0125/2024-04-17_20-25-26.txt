Question: Baker, Cooper, Fletcher, Miller, and Smith live on the first five floors of an apartment house. Baker does not live on the fifth floor. Cooper does not live on the first floor. Fletcher does not live on either the fifth or the first floor. Miller lives on a higher floor than does Cooper. Smith does not live on a floor adjacent to Fletcherâ€™. Fletcher does not live on a floor adjacent to Cooperâ€™s. They all live on different floors. Find the floors where these people live.

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:

```json
{
    "B": int,
    "C": int,
    "F": int,
    "M": int,
    "S": int
}
```

For example, if Baker lives on the 2nd floor, Cooper on the 1st, Fletcher on the 5th, Miller on the 3rd, and Smith on the 4th, then the answer should be:
```json
{
    "B": 2,
    "C": 1,
    "F": 5,
    "M": 3,
    "S": 4
}
```

Decision Variables:
    Define integer variables B, C, F, M, S to represent the floor where Baker, Cooper, Fletcher, Miller, and Smith live, respectively.

Domains:
    Each variable has a domain of [1, 5] as they represent the five different floors.

Constraints:
    Baker's Floor: Baker does not live on the fifth floor. This can be represented as:
    B != 5

    Cooper's Floor: Cooper does not live on the first floor. This can be represented as:
    C != 1

    Fletcher's Floor: Fletcher does not live on the fifth or first floor. This can be represented as:
    F != 5, F != 1

Question: A boy wants to give an apple to a girl. To get to her, he has to pass through five gates, each with a guard. He bribes each guard with half of his apples, plus one. The boy does not have a knife, therefore he gives the guard an integer number of apples. After heâ€™s given the apple to the girl, he has no apples left. How many did he have to begin with and in the process?

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:
```json
{
  "apples": [int]
}
```
where "apples" is an array of 6 integers, each representing the number of apples before each gate, plus the last element being the number of apples given to the girl.

For example, a valid JSON (not the answer) would be:
```json
{
    "apples": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
}
```


Decision Variables:
    Define integer variables A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, A6 to represent the number of apples the boy has before passing through each gate and the number of apples given to the girl.

Domains:
    Each variable has a domain of positive integers.

Constraints:
    The boy gives half of his apples plus one to each guard, so the number of apples after passing through each gate can be represented as:
    A2 = (A1 / 2) - 1
    A3 = (A2 / 2) - 1
    A4 = (A3 / 2) - 1
    A5 = (A4 / 2) - 1
    A6 = (A5 / 2) - 1

    The boy has no apples left after giving the last apple to the girl, so:
    A6 = 0

Objective:
    There is no objective function in this problem as we are not optimizing anything. We are simply finding a feasible solution that satisfies all the constraints.

Question: A magic square is an n x n grid (n != 2) such that each cell contains a different integer from 1 to n^2 and the sum of the integers in each row, column and diagonal is equal. Find a magic square for size 4, knowing that the sum of integers of each row, column and diagonal has to be equal to n(n^2+ 1)/2 (integer).

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:
```json
{
    "square": [[int]]
}

For example, a 3x3 magic square should be given as:
```json
{
    "square": [[2, 7, 6], [9, 5, 1], [4, 3, 8]]
}
```
This means that the first row of the square is [2, 7, 6], the second row is [9, 5, 1] and the third row is [4, 3, 8].
Decision Variables:
    Define a 4x4 matrix variable square to represent the magic square.

Domains:
    Each cell in the square matrix has a domain of integers from 1 to 16 (4^2) as each cell should contain a different integer from 1 to n^2.

Constraints:
    Different Integers: All integers in the square matrix must be different. This can be represented as:
    AllDifferent(flatten(square))

    Row Sums: The sum of integers in each row must be equal to the magic sum. This can be represented as:
    sum(square[i][j] for j in range(4)) == magic_sum for i in range(4)

    Column Sums: The sum of integers in each column must be equal to the magic sum. This can be represented as:
    sum(square[i][j] for i in range(4)) == magic_sum for j in range(4)

    Diagonal Sums: The sum of integers in each diagonal must be equal to the magic sum. This can be represented as:
    sum(square[i][i] for i in range(4)) == magic_sum
    sum(square[i][3-i] for i in range(4)) == magic_sum

Question: Following a robbery at Sparkles the Jewellerâ€™s, Inspector Korner of the Yard interviewed six of the usual suspects. He knew that the getaway car had been barely big enough to hold two, so he reckoned that at least four of them were innocent - but which ones? He also supposed that the innocent ones would tell the truth, while the guilty one or ones would lie. What they actually said was:
- ARTIE: "It wasn't me."
- BILL: "Crackitt was in it up to his neck."
- CRACKITT: "No I wasn't."
- DODGY: "If Crackitt did it, Bill did it with him."
- EDGY: "Nobody did it alone."
- FINGERS: "Thatâ€™s right: it was Artie and Dodgy together."
If the good inspectorâ€™s suppositions were correct, who is guilty?

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:
```json
{
    "artie": 0 | 1,
    "bill": 0 | 1,
    "crackitt": 0 | 1,
    "dodgy": 0 | 1,
    "edgy": 0 | 1,
    "fingers": 0 | 1
}
```

Where 0 means that the suspect is innocent and 1 means that the suspect is guilty.

For example, if the guilty suspect is Artie, Bill, and Crackitt, the answer should be:
```json
{
    "artie": 1,
    "bill": 1,
    "crackitt": 1,
    "dodgy": 0,
    "edgy": 0,
    "fingers": 0
}
```
Decision Variables:
    Define binary variables for each suspect to represent whether they are guilty (1) or innocent (0). The variables are: artie, bill, crackitt, dodgy, edgy, fingers.

Constraints:
    At least four are innocent: At least four suspects are innocent. This can be represented as:
    artie + bill + crackitt + dodgy + edgy + fingers >= 4

    Truthful and Lying Statements:
    - Artie: "It wasn't me." (Truthful if innocent, Lying if guilty)
    - Bill: "Crackitt was in it up to his neck." (Truthful if innocent, Lying if guilty)
    - Crackitt: "No I wasn't." (Truthful if innocent, Lying if guilty)
    - Dodgy: "If Crackitt did it, Bill did it with him." (Truthful if innocent, Lying if guilty)
    - Edgy: "Nobody did it alone." (Truthful if innocent, Lying if guilty)
    - Fingers: "That's right: it was Artie and Dodgy together." (Truthful if innocent, Lying if guilty)

    The above statements can be translated into constraints based on the guilt status of each suspect.

Objective:
    There is no objective function in this problem as we are not optimizing anything. We are simply finding a feasible solution that satisfies all the constraints.

Question: Alice has to give Bob change of 199 euros. She has 6 different types of coins of different value ([1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50]) and she has a certain number of coins of each value available ([20, 10, 15, 8, 4, 2]). How can the change be composed with the available coins minimizing the number of coins used?

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:
```json
{
    "coin_counts": [int]
}
```

For example, if she gives to Bob 1 coin of value 1 and 3 coins of value 25, then the answer should be:
```json
{
    "coin_counts": [1, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0]
}
```

Decision Variables:
    Define integer variables for each type of coin to represent the number of coins of that value used. The variable 'coin_counts' is an array of size equal to the number of coin types (6 in this case).

Domains:
    Each variable representing the number of coins of a specific value has a domain of [0, maximum number of coins available for that value].

Constraints:
    Total Value: The total value of the coins used must sum up to 199 euros. This can be represented as:
    1*coin_counts[0] + 2*coin_counts[1] + 5*coin_counts[2] + 10*coin_counts[3] + 25*coin_counts[4] + 50*coin_counts[5] = 199

Objective:
    Minimize the total number of coins used. This can be achieved by minimizing the sum of all coin counts.

Solution:
    Solve the model and if a solution is found, print the solution in the specified format. The solution is a JSON object with a single key 'coin_counts' whose value is a list of integers representing the number of coins used for each coin type.

Question: We want to assign a different colour to the following countries: Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Netherlands and Luxembourg.
Two neighbouring countries cannot have the same colour.
Read the data below with the graph representing the adjacency of the countries: each pair (i; j) means that country i is adjacent to country j.
You can use integers starting from 1 to represent the colours.
Find a colouring that minimizes the number of colours used.

Here is the data:
{
    "num_edges": 9,
    "graph": [
        [3, 1],
        [3, 6],
        [3, 4],
        [6, 4],
        [6, 1],
        [1, 5],
        [1, 4],
        [4, 5],
        [4, 2]
    ],
    "nodes": ["Belgium", "Denmark", "France", "Germany", "Netherlands", "Luxembourg"]
}

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:
```json
{
    "colors": [int]
}
```
where the list of integers represents the colours assigned to the countries in the order they are given in the input.

For example, a valid JSON (not the answer) would be:
```json
{
    "colors": [1, 2, 4, 2, 3, 5]
}
```

Decision Variables:
    Define integer variables for each country to represent the color assigned to that country. The variable 'colors' is an array of size equal to the number of countries (6 in this case).

Domains:
    Each variable has a domain of [1, n] where n is the maximum number of colors that can be used.

Constraints:
    Different Colors for Neighbors: Two neighboring countries cannot have the same color. This can be represented by iterating over the edges in the graph and adding a constraint that the colors of the two countries connected by the edge must be different.

Objective:
    Minimize the number of colors used. This can be achieved by minimizing the maximum value in the 'colors' array.

Solution:
    Solve the model and if a solution is found, print the solution in the specified format. The solution is a JSON object with a single key 'colors' whose value is a list of integers representing the colors assigned to the countries in the order they are given in the input.

    ]
}

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:
```json
{
    "selected_movies": [0 | 1]
}
```

where 0 or 1 is the binary value indicating whether the movie is selected or not, in the same order as the input.

For example, a valid JSON (but not the correct answer) would be:

Question: A bank van had several bags of coins, each containing either 16, 17, 23, 24, 39, or 40 coins (there are multiple bags of the same kind). While the van was parked on the street, thieves stole some bags. A total of 100 coins were lost. It is required to find how many bags were stolen for each type of coin bag.

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:
```json
{
  "bags": [int]
}
```
where `bags` is a list of integers, each representing the number of bags stolen for each type of coin bag. The order of the integers in the list should be the same as the order of the coin bags in the input list.

For example, if they stole 2 bags of 16 coins and 3 bags of 40 coins, the answer should be:
```json
{
  "bags": [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3]
}
```
Decision Variables:
    Define integer variables for each type of coin bag to represent the number of bags stolen for that type. The variable 'bags' is a list of integers with a size equal to the number of different coin bags (6 in this case).

Domains:
    Each variable has a domain of [0, infinity] as the number of bags stolen can be any non-negative integer.

Constraints:
    Total Coins Lost: The total number of coins lost is 100. This can be represented as:
    16 * bags[0] + 17 * bags[1] + 23 * bags[2] + 24 * bags[3] + 39 * bags[4] + 40 * bags[5] = 100

Objective:
    There is no objective function in this problem as we are not optimizing anything. We are simply finding a feasible solution that satisfies all the constraints.

Question: Out of the set of integers 1,...,100 you are given ten different integers ([81 21 79  4 29 70 28 20 14  7]). From this set A of ten integers you can always find two disjoint non-empty subsets, S and T, such that the sum of elements in S equals the sum of elements in T. Note: S union T does not need to be all ten elements of A. Find sets S and T for the given set A.

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:
```json
{
  "in_S": [0 | 1],
  "in_T": [0 | 1]
}
```
where in_S and in_T are arrays of 10 elements each. The elements of in_S and in_T should be 0 or 1, depending on whether the corresponding element of A is in S or T.

For example, if the answer is S = {81} and T = {21, 79}, the answer should be:
```json
{
  "in_S": [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  "in_T": [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
}
```
Decision Variables:
    Define two arrays of binary variables in_S and in_T, each of size 10, to represent whether the corresponding element of A is in set S or set T.

Constraints:
    Disjoint Subsets: The subsets S and T must be disjoint, meaning an element cannot be in both sets. This can be represented as:
    in_S[i] + in_T[i] <= 1 for all i in [0, 9]

    Sum Equality: The sum of elements in set S must be equal to the sum of elements in set T. This can be represented as:
    Sum(in_S[i] * A[i]) = Sum(in_T[i] * A[i])

Objective:
    There is no objective function in this problem as we are not optimizing anything. We are simply finding a feasible solution that satisfies all the constraints.

Question: In graph theory, an independent set is a set of vertices in a graph, no two of which are adjacent. A maximal independent set is an independent set that is not a subset of any other independent set. A graph may have many maximal independent sets of widely varying sizes: find the maximal independent sets for the data provided. The data provides an array containing for each node of the graph the set of adjacent nodes.

Here is the data:
{
    "n": 8,
    "adjacency_list": [  // indexing is 1-based
        [2, 3, 7],
        [1, 4, 8],
        [1, 4, 5],
        [2, 3, 6],
        [3, 6, 7],
        [4, 5, 8],
        [1, 5, 8],
        [2, 6, 7]
    ]
}

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:
```json
{
    "nodes": [0 | 1]
}
```
where `nodes` is an array of 0s and 1s, where 1 indicates that the node is part of the maximal independent set and 0 indicates that it is not.

For example, a valid JSON (but not the answer for the example above) would be:
```json
{
    "nodes": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
}
```
Decision Variables:
    Define a binary variable for each node to represent whether the node is part of the maximal independent set. The variable 'nodes' is an array of size equal to the number of nodes in the graph.

Constraints:
    Independent Set: No two adjacent nodes can both be part of the maximal independent set. This can be represented by iterating over the nodes and for each node, add a constraint that if the node is selected (nodes[i] = 1), then none of its adjacent nodes can be selected (nodes[j] = 0).

Objective:
    There is no objective function in this problem as we are not optimizing anything. We are simply finding a feasible solution that satisfies all the constraints.

Solution:

Question: In preparation for Passover, five children at Hebrew school (Bernice, Carl, Debby, Sammy, and Ted) have been chosen to present different parts of the story of the Exodus from Egypt (burning bush, captivity, Mosesâ€™s youth, Passover, or the Ten Commandments). Each child is a different age (three, five, seven, eight, or ten), and the family of each child has recently made its own exodus to America from a different country (Ethiopia, Kazakhstan, Lithuania, Morocco, or Yemen). Can you find the age of each child, his or her familyâ€™s country of origin, and the part of the Exodus story each related?
1. Debbyâ€™s family is from Lithuania.
2. The child who told the story of the Passover is two years older than Bernice.
3. The child whose family is from Yemen is younger than the child from the Ethiopian family.
4. The child from the Moroccan family is three years older than Ted.

Question: There are 13 people. 4 of them are male. They randomly enter a room one at a time. Find a way that the males and females enter so that the ratio of females to males in the room at any one time is no greater than 7/3?

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:
```json
{
  "sequence": [0 | 1]
}
```
where 0 means a male enters the room, and 1 means a female enters the room.

For example a valid JSON (but not a valid answer) would be:
```json
{
  "sequence": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
}
```
Decision Variables:
    Define a sequence of binary variables S of length 13, where S[i] = 0 represents a male entering the room and S[i] = 1 represents a female entering the room.

Constraints:
    Ratio Constraint: At any point in the sequence, the ratio of females to males in the room should not exceed 7/3. This can be represented by iterating over the sequence and adding a constraint that the cumulative sum of females should not be more than 7 times the cumulative sum of males at any point.

Objective:
    There is no objective function in this problem as we are not optimizing anything. We are simply finding a feasible sequence that satisfies all the constraints.

Question: At the hospital n people are on a waiting list for a kidneyâ€™s transplant. We have the information about the compatibility between these people as a directed graph: compatible[i] is the set of people to which i can donate. Given this information, we want to maximize the number of people that receive a new kidney: anyone who gives a kidney must receive one, and no person receives more than one kidney. Use the following data:

{
    "num_people": 8,
    "compatible": [  // 1-based index
        [2, 3],
        [1, 6],
        [1, 4, 7],
        [2],
        [2],
        [5],
        [8],
        [3]
    ]
}

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:
```json
{
    "transplants": [[0 | 1]]
}
```

Where transplants[i][j] is 1 if person i gives a kidney to person j, and 0 otherwise.

For example, a valid JSON (but not the answer for the example above) would be:
```json
{
    "transplants": [
        [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

    For all j in [0, num_people-1], Sum(transplants[i][j] for i in [0, num_people-1]) <= 1

    Compatibility constraint: If person i gives a kidney to person j, then j must be in the compatible list of i. This can be represented as:
    For all i in [0, num_people-1], for all j in [0, num_people-1], transplants[i][j] == 0 or j+1 in compatible[i+1]

Question: A farmer has 25 cows numbered 1 to 25. number 1 cow gives 1kg milk, number 2 gives 2 kg... number and so on up to number 25 that gives 25 kg per day. The farmer has 5 sons and he wants to distribute his cows to them: 7 to the first, 6 to the second and so on down to 3 to the last, however, the total quantity of milk produced should be the same: how can he distribute the cows?

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:
```json
{
    "cow_assignments": [int]
}
```
where `cow_assignments` is a list of 25 integers (from 0 to 4) that maps the cow to the son.
Decision Variables:
    Define a list of 25 integer variables cow_assignments representing the assignment of each cow to a son. Each variable takes values from 0 to 4, where 0 represents the first son, 1 represents the second son, and so on up to 4 representing the fifth son.

Domains:
    Each variable in cow_assignments has a domain of [0, 4] representing the five sons.

Constraints:
    Total Milk Quantity: The total quantity of milk produced by the cows assigned to each son should be the same. This can be represented as:
    Sum of (i+1) for all cows assigned to son j should be equal to the sum of (i+1) for all cows assigned to son k, for all j, k in [0, 4]

Question: A kid goes into a grocery store and buys four items. The cashier charges $7.11, the kid pays and is about to leave when the cashier calls the kid back, and says "Hold on, I multiplied the four items instead of adding them; Iâ€™ll try again; Hah, with adding them the price still comes to $7.11". What were the prices of the four items?

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:
```json
{
  "prices": [int]
}
```
where `prices` is a list of four integers representing the prices of the four items in cents.

For example, a valid JSON (but not the answer for the example above) would be:

Decision Variables:
    Define integer variables p1, p2, p3, p4 to represent the prices of the four items in cents.

Constraints:
    Total Price: The total price of the four items should be $7.11, which is 711 cents. This can be represented as:
    p1 + p2 + p3 + p4 == 711

    Multiplication Mistake: If the cashier mistakenly multiplied the prices instead of adding them, the total price would be the product of the prices. This can be represented as:
    p1 * p2 * p3 * p4 == 711
