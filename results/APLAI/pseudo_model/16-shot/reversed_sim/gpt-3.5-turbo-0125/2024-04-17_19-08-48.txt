Question: Baker, Cooper, Fletcher, Miller, and Smith live on the first five floors of an apartment house. Baker does not live on the fifth floor. Cooper does not live on the first floor. Fletcher does not live on either the fifth or the first floor. Miller lives on a higher floor than does Cooper. Smith does not live on a floor adjacent to Fletcherâ€™. Fletcher does not live on a floor adjacent to Cooperâ€™s. They all live on different floors. Find the floors where these people live.

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:

```json
{
    "B": int,
    "C": int,
    "F": int,
    "M": int,
    "S": int
}
```

For example, if Baker lives on the 2nd floor, Cooper on the 1st, Fletcher on the 5th, Miller on the 3rd, and Smith on the 4th, then the answer should be:
```json
{
    "B": 2,
    "C": 1,
    "F": 5,
    "M": 3,
    "S": 4
}
```

Decision Variables:
    Define integer variables B, C, F, M, S to represent the floor where Baker, Cooper, Fletcher, Miller, and Smith live, respectively.

Domains:
    Each variable has a domain of [1, 5] as there are five floors in the apartment house.

Constraints:
    Baker does not live on the fifth floor: This can be represented as:
    B != 5

    Cooper does not live on the first floor: This can be represented as:
    C != 1

    Fletcher does not live on either the fifth or the first floor: This can be represented as:
    F != 5
    F != 1

    Miller lives on a higher floor than Cooper: This can be represented as:
    M > C

    Smith does not live on a floor adjacent to Fletcher: This can be represented as:
    |S - F| != 1

    Fletcher does not live on a floor adjacent to Cooper: This can be represented as:
    |F - C| != 1

    All live on different floors: This can be represented by adding AllDifferent constraints for the variables B, C, F, M, S.

Objective:
    There is no objective function in this problem as we are not optimizing anything. We are simply finding a feasible solution that satisfies all the constraints.

Question: A boy wants to give an apple to a girl. To get to her, he has to pass through five gates, each with a guard. He bribes each guard with half of his apples, plus one. The boy does not have a knife, therefore he gives the guard an integer number of apples. After heâ€™s given the apple to the girl, he has no apples left. How many did he have to begin with and in the process?

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:
```json
{
  "apples": [int]
}
```
where "apples" is an array of 6 integers, each representing the number of apples before each gate, plus the last element being the number of apples given to the girl.

For example, a valid JSON (not the answer) would be:
```json
{
    "apples": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
}
```


Decision Variables:
    Define integer variables for each gate to represent the number of apples the boy has before passing through each gate. The variable 'apples' is an array of size 6.

Domains:
    Each variable in 'apples' has a domain of positive integers.

Constraints:
    Bribe Calculation: The boy bribes each guard with half of his apples, plus one. This can be represented by the equation:
    apples[i+1] = (apples[i] / 2) + 1

    Final Apple Count: After giving the apple to the girl, the boy has no apples left. This can be represented by the equation:
    apples[5] = 0

Question: A magic square is an n x n grid (n != 2) such that each cell contains a different integer from 1 to n^2 and the sum of the integers in each row, column and diagonal is equal. Find a magic square for size 4, knowing that the sum of integers of each row, column and diagonal has to be equal to n(n^2+ 1)/2 (integer).

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:
```json
{
    "square": [[int]]
}

For example, a 3x3 magic square should be given as:
```json
{
    "square": [[2, 7, 6], [9, 5, 1], [4, 3, 8]]
}
```
This means that the first row of the square is [2, 7, 6], the second row is [9, 5, 1] and the third row is [4, 3, 8].
Decision Variables:
    Define a 2D array of integer variables named square to represent the magic square.

Domains:
    Each variable in the square has a domain of [1, n^2] where n is the size of the magic square (4 in this case).

Constraints:
    Different Numbers: All numbers in the magic square must be different. This can be represented by adding a constraint that all elements in the square array are different.

    Row Sums: The sum of integers in each row must be equal to the magic sum. This can be represented by adding constraints that the sum of integers in each row is equal to the magic sum.

    Column Sums: The sum of integers in each column must be equal to the magic sum. This can be represented by adding constraints that the sum of integers in each column is equal to the magic sum.

Question: Following a robbery at Sparkles the Jewellerâ€™s, Inspector Korner of the Yard interviewed six of the usual suspects. He knew that the getaway car had been barely big enough to hold two, so he reckoned that at least four of them were innocent - but which ones? He also supposed that the innocent ones would tell the truth, while the guilty one or ones would lie. What they actually said was:
- ARTIE: "It wasn't me."
- BILL: "Crackitt was in it up to his neck."
- CRACKITT: "No I wasn't."
- DODGY: "If Crackitt did it, Bill did it with him."
- EDGY: "Nobody did it alone."
- FINGERS: "Thatâ€™s right: it was Artie and Dodgy together."
If the good inspectorâ€™s suppositions were correct, who is guilty?

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:
```json
{
    "artie": 0 | 1,
    "bill": 0 | 1,
    "crackitt": 0 | 1,
    "dodgy": 0 | 1,
    "edgy": 0 | 1,
    "fingers": 0 | 1
}
```

Where 0 means that the suspect is innocent and 1 means that the suspect is guilty.

For example, if the guilty suspect is Artie, Bill, and Crackitt, the answer should be:
```json
{
    "artie": 1,
    "bill": 1,
    "crackitt": 1,
    "dodgy": 0,
    "edgy": 0,
    "fingers": 0
}
```
Decision Variables:
    Define binary variables for each suspect to represent whether the suspect is guilty (1) or innocent (0). The variables 'artie', 'bill', 'crackitt', 'dodgy', 'edgy', and 'fingers' are binary variables.

Domains:
    Each variable has a domain of {0, 1} where 0 represents innocent and 1 represents guilty.

Constraints:
    At least four suspects are innocent: This can be represented by adding a constraint that the sum of all suspects being innocent is at least 4.
    Truthful statements: If a suspect is guilty, their statement is a lie. If a suspect is innocent, their statement is true. This can be represented by adding constraints based on the statements made by each suspect and the guilt status of each suspect.

Objective:
    There is no objective function in this problem as we are not optimizing anything. We are simply finding a feasible solution that satisfies all the constraints.

Question: Alice has to give Bob change of 199 euros. She has 6 different types of coins of different value ([1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50]) and she has a certain number of coins of each value available ([20, 10, 15, 8, 4, 2]). How can the change be composed with the available coins minimizing the number of coins used?

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:
```json
{
    "coin_counts": [int]
}
```

For example, if she gives to Bob 1 coin of value 1 and 3 coins of value 25, then the answer should be:
```json
{
    "coin_counts": [1, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0]
}
```

Decision Variables:
    Define an array of integer variables named coin_counts to represent the number of coins used for each type of coin [1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50].

Domains:
    Each coin count variable has a domain of [0, max_count] where max_count is the maximum number of coins available for that type.

Constraints:
    Total Change: The sum of the products of each coin count and its corresponding coin value must equal the total change needed, which is 199 euros. This is captured by the equation:
    1*coin_counts[0] + 2*coin_counts[1] + 5*coin_counts[2] + 10*coin_counts[3] + 25*coin_counts[4] + 50*coin_counts[5] = 199

Objective:
    The objective is to minimize the total number of coins used. This can be achieved by minimizing the sum of the coin_counts array.

Question: We want to assign a different colour to the following countries: Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Netherlands and Luxembourg.
Two neighbouring countries cannot have the same colour.
Read the data below with the graph representing the adjacency of the countries: each pair (i; j) means that country i is adjacent to country j.
You can use integers starting from 1 to represent the colours.
Find a colouring that minimizes the number of colours used.

Here is the data:
{
    "num_edges": 9,
    "graph": [
        [3, 1],
        [3, 6],
        [3, 4],

        [4, 5],
        [4, 2]
    ],
    "nodes": ["Belgium", "Denmark", "France", "Germany", "Netherlands", "Luxembourg"]
}

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:
```json
{
    "colors": [int]
}
```
where the list of integers represents the colours assigned to the countries in the order they are given in the input.

For example, a valid JSON (not the answer) would be:
```json
{
    "colors": [1, 2, 4, 2, 3, 5]
}
```

Decision Variables:
    Define integer variables for each country to represent the colour assigned to that country. The variable 'colors' is an array of size equal to the number of countries (6 in this case).

Domains:
    Each variable in 'colors' has a domain of integers starting from 1, representing the colours assigned to the countries.

Question: Please schedule non-overlapping movie showings at a cinema to maximize the number of shows one can watch.

Here is the data:
{
    "num_movies": 9,
    "movies": [
        {"title": "Tarjan of the Jungle", "interval": [4, 13]},
        {"title": "The Four Volume Problem", "interval": [17, 27]},

        {"title": "Calculated Bets", "interval": [26, 31]}
    ]
}

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:
```json
{
    "selected_movies": [0 | 1]
}
```

where 0 or 1 is the binary value indicating whether the movie is selected or not, in the same order as the input.

For example, a valid JSON (but not the correct answer) would be:
```json
{
    "selected_movies": [1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
}
```

where the selected movies are Tarjan of the Jungle, The President's Algorist and Steiner's Tree.
Decision Variables:
    Define binary variables for each movie to represent whether the movie is selected (1) or not (0). The variable 'selected_movies' is an array of size equal to the number of movies (9 in this case).

Domains:
    selected_movies[i] âˆˆ {0, 1} for each movie i. The value 1 indicates that the movie is selected, and 0 indicates that it is not.

Constraints:
    Non-overlapping Showings: The intervals of selected movies should not overlap. This can be represented by iterating over the movies and for each pair of movies i and j, add a constraint that if both movies are selected, then their intervals should not overlap.

Objective:
    Maximize the number of selected movies. This can be represented by adding a maximize objective to the model with the sum of the 'selected_movies' array as the objective.

Question: A bank van had several bags of coins, each containing either 16, 17, 23, 24, 39, or 40 coins (there are multiple bags of the same kind). While the van was parked on the street, thieves stole some bags. A total of 100 coins were lost. It is required to find how many bags were stolen for each type of coin bag.

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:
```json
{
  "bags": [int]
}
```
where `bags` is a list of integers, each representing the number of bags stolen for each type of coin bag. The order of the integers in the list should be the same as the order of the coin bags in the input list.

For example, if they stole 2 bags of 16 coins and 3 bags of 40 coins, the answer should be:
```json
{
  "bags": [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3]
}
```
Decision Variables:
    Define integer variables for each type of coin bag to represent the number of bags stolen for that type. The variable 'bags' is an array of size equal to the number of different types of coin bags (6 in this case).

Domains:
    Each variable in 'bags' has a domain of [0, +inf) as the number of bags stolen can be any non-negative integer.

Constraints:
    Total Coins Lost: The total number of coins lost is 100. This can be represented by the equation:
    16 * bags[0] + 17 * bags[1] + 23 * bags[2] + 24 * bags[3] + 39 * bags[4] + 40 * bags[5] = 100

Objective:
    There is no objective function in this problem as we are not optimizing anything. We are simply finding a feasible solution that satisfies all the constraints.

Question: Out of the set of integers 1,...,100 you are given ten different integers ([81 21 79  4 29 70 28 20 14  7]). From this set A of ten integers you can always find two disjoint non-empty subsets, S and T, such that the sum of elements in S equals the sum of elements in T. Note: S union T does not need to be all ten elements of A. Find sets S and T for the given set A.

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:
```json
{
  "in_S": [0 | 1],
  "in_T": [0 | 1]
}
```
where in_S and in_T are arrays of 10 elements each. The elements of in_S and in_T should be 0 or 1, depending on whether the corresponding element of A is in S or T.

For example, if the answer is S = {81} and T = {21, 79}, the answer should be:
```json
{
  "in_S": [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  "in_T": [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
}
```
Decision Variables:
    Define binary variables for each element in the given set A to represent whether the element is in subset S (in_S) or subset T (in_T). The variables 'in_S' and 'in_T' are arrays of size 10, corresponding to the 10 elements in the given set A.

Domains:
    in_S[i], in_T[i] âˆˆ {0, 1} for each element i in the set A. The value 1 indicates that the element is in the corresponding subset, and 0 indicates that it is not.

Constraints:
    Disjoint Subsets: The subsets S and T must be disjoint, meaning no element can be in both subsets. This can be represented by adding a constraint that the sum of in_S and in_T for each element i must be less than or equal to 1.

    Sum Equality: The sum of elements in subset S must be equal to the sum of elements in subset T. This can be represented by adding a constraint that the sum of the products of each element in A with its corresponding in_S is equal to the sum of the products of each element in A with its corresponding in_T.

Objective:
    There is no specific objective in this problem as we are not asked to optimize anything. We are just looking for a feasible solution that satisfies the constraints.

Question: In graph theory, an independent set is a set of vertices in a graph, no two of which are adjacent. A maximal independent set is an independent set that is not a subset of any other independent set. A graph may have many maximal independent sets of widely varying sizes: find the maximal independent sets for the data provided. The data provides an array containing for each node of the graph the set of adjacent nodes.

Here is the data:
{
    "n": 8,
    "adjacency_list": [  // indexing is 1-based
        [2, 3, 7],
        [1, 4, 8],
        [1, 4, 5],
        [2, 3, 6],
        [3, 6, 7],
        [4, 5, 8],
        [1, 5, 8],
        [2, 6, 7]
    ]
}

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:
```json
{
    "nodes": [0 | 1]
}
```
where `nodes` is an array of 0s and 1s, where 1 indicates that the node is part of the maximal independent set and 0 indicates that it is not.

For example, a valid JSON (but not the answer for the example above) would be:
```json
{
    "nodes": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
}
```
Decision Variables:
    Define binary variables for each node to represent whether the node is part of the maximal independent set (1) or not (0). The variable 'nodes' is an array of size equal to the number of nodes (8 in this case).

Domains:
    nodes[i] âˆˆ {0, 1} for each node i. The value 1 indicates that the node is part of the maximal independent set, and 0 indicates that it is not.

Constraints:
    Independent Set: No two adjacent nodes can both be part of the maximal independent set. This can be represented by iterating over the adjacency list and for each pair of adjacent nodes (i, j), add a constraint that nodes[i] + nodes[j] â‰¤ 1.

Objective:
    There is no specific objective in this problem as we are not asked to maximize or minimize anything. We are just looking for a feasible solution that satisfies the constraints.

Question: In preparation for Passover, five children at Hebrew school (Bernice, Carl, Debby, Sammy, and Ted) have been chosen to present different parts of the story of the Exodus from Egypt (burning bush, captivity, Mosesâ€™s youth, Passover, or the Ten Commandments). Each child is a different age (three, five, seven, eight, or ten), and the family of each child has recently made its own exodus to America from a different country (Ethiopia, Kazakhstan, Lithuania, Morocco, or Yemen). Can you find the age of each child, his or her familyâ€™s country of origin, and the part of the Exodus story each related?
1. Debbyâ€™s family is from Lithuania.
2. The child who told the story of the Passover is two years older than Bernice.
3. The child whose family is from Yemen is younger than the child from the Ethiopian family.
4. The child from the Moroccan family is three years older than Ted.
5. Sammy is three years older than the child who told the story of Mosesâ€™s youth in the house of the Pharaoh.
Determine the association: Age-Child-Country-Story.

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:
```json
{
    "ages": [int],
    "children": [int],
    "countries": [int],
    "stories": [int]
}
```
Where each list contains integers from 1 to 5 representing the mapping of the children to the ages, countries, and stories. The numbers should be in the same order as the entities in the question (alphabetical order).

For example, a valid JSON (but not the answer for the example above) would be:

}
```
Decision Variables:
    Define integer variables for each child to represent their age, country of origin, and the part of the Exodus story they related. The variables 'ages', 'children', 'countries', and 'stories' are arrays of size 5.

Domains:

Constraints:
    Debby's family is from Lithuania. This can be represented as:
    countries[3] = 3

    The child who told the story of the Passover is two years older than Bernice. This can be represented as:
    ages[2] + 2 = ages[0]

    The child whose family is from Yemen is younger than the child from the Ethiopian family. This can be represented as:
    (countries[4] == 5) -> (ages[4] < ages[1])

    The child from the Moroccan family is three years older than Ted. This can be represented as:

Question: There are 13 people. 4 of them are male. They randomly enter a room one at a time. Find a way that the males and females enter so that the ratio of females to males in the room at any one time is no greater than 7/3?

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:
```json
{
  "sequence": [0 | 1]
}
```
where 0 means a male enters the room, and 1 means a female enters the room.

For example a valid JSON (but not a valid answer) would be:
```json
{
  "sequence": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
}
```
Decision Variables:
    Define binary variables for each person to represent whether a male (0) or a female (1) enters the room. The variable 'sequence' is an array of size 13.

Domains:
    Each variable in 'sequence' has a domain of {0, 1} where 0 represents a male and 1 represents a female.

Constraints:
    Ratio Constraint: At any point in the sequence, the ratio of females to males in the room should not be greater than 7/3. This can be represented by iterating over the sequence and for each person, adding a constraint that the sum of females should not be more than 7/3 times the sum of males at that point.

Objective:
    There is no objective function in this problem as we are not optimizing anything. We are simply finding a feasible solution that satisfies the constraints.

Question: At the hospital n people are on a waiting list for a kidneyâ€™s transplant. We have the information about the compatibility between these people as a directed graph: compatible[i] is the set of people to which i can donate. Given this information, we want to maximize the number of people that receive a new kidney: anyone who gives a kidney must receive one, and no person receives more than one kidney. Use the following data:

{
    "num_people": 8,
    "compatible": [  // 1-based index
        [2, 3],
        [1, 6],
        [1, 4, 7],
        [2],
        [2],
        [5],
        [8],
        [3]
    ]
}

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:
```json
{
    "transplants": [[0 | 1]]
}
```

Where transplants[i][j] is 1 if person i gives a kidney to person j, and 0 otherwise.

For example, a valid JSON (but not the answer for the example above) would be:
```json
{
    "transplants": [
        [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
    ]
}
```
Decision Variables:
    Define binary variables for each pair of people to represent whether person i gives a kidney to person j (1) or not (0). The variable 'transplants' is a 2D array of size num_people x num_people.

Domains:
    transplants[i][j] âˆˆ {0, 1} for each pair of people i, j. The value 1 indicates that person i gives a kidney to person j, and 0 indicates that person i does not give a kidney to person j.

Constraints:
    Each person who gives a kidney must receive one. This can be represented by adding constraints that ensure that for each person i, the sum of transplants[i][j] for all j is equal to 1.

    No person receives more than one kidney. This can be represented by adding constraints that ensure that for each person j, the sum of transplants[i][j] for all i is less than or equal to 1.

    Compatibility constraints: If person i can donate to person j, then transplants[i][j] should be 1. This can be represented by adding constraints that ensure that if person i can donate to person j, then transplants[i][j] should be 1.

Objective:
    Maximize the number of people that receive a new kidney. This can be represented by adding a maximize objective to the model with the sum of the 'transplants' array as the objective.

Question: A farmer has 25 cows numbered 1 to 25. number 1 cow gives 1kg milk, number 2 gives 2 kg... number and so on up to number 25 that gives 25 kg per day. The farmer has 5 sons and he wants to distribute his cows to them: 7 to the first, 6 to the second and so on down to 3 to the last, however, the total quantity of milk produced should be the same: how can he distribute the cows?

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:
```json
{
    "cow_assignments": [int]
}
```
where `cow_assignments` is a list of 25 integers (from 0 to 4) that maps the cow to the son.
Decision Variables:
    Define an array of integer variables named cow_assignments to represent the assignment of each cow to a son. The variable 'cow_assignments' is an array of size 25.

Domains:
    Each cow assignment variable has a domain of [0, 4] as there are 5 sons to distribute the cows to.

Constraints:
    Total Milk Quantity: The total quantity of milk produced by the cows assigned to each son should be the same. This can be represented by adding a constraint that the sum of the milk produced by the cows assigned to each son should be equal to the total milk produced by all cows, which is 325 kg.

Objective:
    There is no specific objective in this problem as we are not asked to optimize anything. We are just looking for a feasible solution that satisfies the constraint.

Question: A kid goes into a grocery store and buys four items. The cashier charges $7.11, the kid pays and is about to leave when the cashier calls the kid back, and says "Hold on, I multiplied the four items instead of adding them; Iâ€™ll try again; Hah, with adding them the price still comes to $7.11". What were the prices of the four items?

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:
```json
{
  "prices": [int]
}
```
where `prices` is a list of four integers representing the prices of the four items in cents.

For example, a valid JSON (but not the answer for the example above) would be:
```json
{
  "prices": [120, 210, 100, 123]
}
```
Decision Variables:
    Define an array of integer variables named prices to represent the prices of the four items in cents.

Domains:
    Each price variable has a domain of [1, 711] as the prices are in cents and the total should be $7.11 (711 cents).

Constraints:
    Total Price: The sum of the prices of the four items must be equal to $7.11, which is 711 cents. This is captured by the equation:
    prices[0] + prices[1] + prices[2] + prices[3] = 711

    Multiplication Mistake: If the cashier mistakenly multiplied the prices instead of adding them, the total would be much higher. This can be represented by the equation:
    prices[0] * prices[1] * prices[2] * prices[3] != 711^2

Objective:
    There is no specific objective in this problem as we are not asked to optimize anything. We are simply looking for a feasible solution that satisfies the constraints.
