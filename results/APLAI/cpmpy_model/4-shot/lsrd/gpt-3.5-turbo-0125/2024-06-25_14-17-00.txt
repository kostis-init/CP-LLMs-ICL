Question: Baker, Cooper, Fletcher, Miller, and Smith live on the first five floors of an apartment house. Baker does not live on the fifth floor. Cooper does not live on the first floor. Fletcher does not live on either the fifth or the first floor. Miller lives on a higher floor than does Cooper. Smith does not live on a floor adjacent to Fletcher’. Fletcher does not live on a floor adjacent to Cooper’s. They all live on different floors. Find the floors where these people live.

Question: A bank van had several bags of coins, each containing either 16, 17, 23, 24, 39, or 40 coins (there are multiple bags of the same kind). While the van was parked on the street, thieves stole some bags. A total of 100 coins were lost. It is required to find how many bags were stolen for each type of coin bag.

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:

Question: At the hospital n people are on a waiting list for a kidney’s transplant. We have the information about the compatibility between these people as a directed graph: compatible[i] is the set of people to which i can donate. Given this information, we want to maximize the number of people that receive a new kidney: anyone who gives a kidney must receive one, and no person receives more than one kidney. Use the following data:

Question: Out of the set of integers 1,...,100 you are given ten different integers ([81 21 79  4 29 70 28 20 14  7]). From this set A of ten integers you can always find two disjoint non-empty subsets, S and T, such that the sum of elements in S equals the sum of elements in T. Note: S union T does not need to be all ten elements of A. Find sets S and T for the given set A.

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:
```json
{
  "in_S": [0 | 1],
  "in_T": [0 | 1]

where in_S and in_T are arrays of 10 elements each. The elements of in_S and in_T should be 0 or 1, depending on whether the corresponding element of A is in S or T.

Question: Following a robbery at Sparkles the Jeweller’s, Inspector Korner of the Yard interviewed six of the usual suspects. He knew that the getaway car had been barely big enough to hold two, so he reckoned that at least four of them were innocent - but which ones? He also supposed that the innocent ones would tell the truth, while the guilty one or ones would lie. What they actually said was:
- ARTIE: "It wasn't me."
- BILL: "Crackitt was in it up to his neck."
- CRACKITT: "No I wasn't."
- DODGY: "If Crackitt did it, Bill did it with him."
- EDGY: "Nobody did it alone."
- FINGERS: "That’s right: it was Artie and Dodgy together."
If the good inspector’s suppositions were correct, who is guilty?

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:
```json
{
    "artie": 0 | 1,
    "bill": 0 | 1,
    "crackitt": 0 | 1,
    "dodgy": 0 | 1,
    "edgy": 0 | 1,
    "fingers": 0 | 1
}
```

Where 0 means that the suspect is innocent and 1 means that the suspect is guilty.

For example, if the guilty suspect is Artie, Bill, and Crackitt, the answer should be:
```json
{
    "artie": 1,
    "bill": 1,
    "crackitt": 1,

Question: In graph theory, an independent set is a set of vertices in a graph, no two of which are adjacent. A maximal independent set is an independent set that is not a subset of any other independent set. A graph may have many maximal independent sets of widely varying sizes: find the maximal independent sets for the data provided. The data provides an array containing for each node of the graph the set of adjacent nodes.

Here is the data:
{
    "n": 8,
    "adjacency_list": [  // indexing is 1-based
        [2, 3, 7],
        [1, 4, 8],

        [2, 3, 6],

        [4, 5, 8],
        [1, 5, 8],
        [2, 6, 7]
    ]
}

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:
```json
{
    "nodes": [0 | 1]
}
```
where `nodes` is an array of 0s and 1s, where 1 indicates that the node is part of the maximal independent set and 0 indicates that it is not.

Question: We want to assign a different colour to the following countries: Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Netherlands and Luxembourg.
Two neighbouring countries cannot have the same colour.
