Question: A boy wants to give an apple to a girl. To get to her, he has to pass through five gates, each with a guard. He bribes each guard with half of his apples, plus one. The boy does not have a knife, therefore he gives the guard an integer number of apples. After he’s given the apple to the girl, he has no apples left. How many did he have to begin with and in the process?

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:
```json

  "apples": [int]

```
where "apples" is an array of 6 integers, each representing the number of apples before each gate, plus the last element being the number of apples given to the girl.

Question: A magic square is an n x n grid (n != 2) such that each cell contains a different integer from 1 to n^2 and the sum of the integers in each row, column and diagonal is equal. Find a magic square for size 4, knowing that the sum of integers of each row, column and diagonal has to be equal to n(n^2+ 1)/2 (integer).

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:

For example, a 3x3 magic square should be given as:
```json

Question: Following a robbery at Sparkles the Jeweller’s, Inspector Korner of the Yard interviewed six of the usual suspects. He knew that the getaway car had been barely big enough to hold two, so he reckoned that at least four of them were innocent - but which ones? He also supposed that the innocent ones would tell the truth, while the guilty one or ones would lie. What they actually said was:
- ARTIE: "It wasn't me."
- BILL: "Crackitt was in it up to his neck."
- CRACKITT: "No I wasn't."
- DODGY: "If Crackitt did it, Bill did it with him."
- EDGY: "Nobody did it alone."
- FINGERS: "That’s right: it was Artie and Dodgy together."
If the good inspector’s suppositions were correct, who is guilty?

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:
```json
{
    "artie": 0 | 1,
    "bill": 0 | 1,
    "crackitt": 0 | 1,
    "dodgy": 0 | 1,
    "edgy": 0 | 1,
    "fingers": 0 | 1
}
```

Where 0 means that the suspect is innocent and 1 means that the suspect is guilty.

For example, if the guilty suspect is Artie, Bill, and Crackitt, the answer should be:
```json
{
    "artie": 1,
    "bill": 1,
    "crackitt": 1,

Question: Out of the set of integers 1,...,100 you are given ten different integers ([81 21 79  4 29 70 28 20 14  7]). From this set A of ten integers you can always find two disjoint non-empty subsets, S and T, such that the sum of elements in S equals the sum of elements in T.

Question: In graph theory, an independent set is a set of vertices in a graph, no two of which are adjacent. A maximal independent set is an independent set that is not a subset of any other independent set. A graph may have many maximal independent sets of widely varying sizes: find the maximal independent sets for the data provided. The data provides an array containing for each node of the graph the set of adjacent nodes.

Here is the data:
{
    "n": 8,
    "adjacency_list": [  // indexing is 1-based
        [2, 3, 7],
        [1, 4, 8],
        [1, 4, 5],
        [2, 3, 6],
        [3, 6, 7],
        [4, 5, 8],
        [1, 5, 8],
        [2, 6, 7]
    ]
}

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:
```json
{
    "nodes": [0 | 1]
}
```
where `nodes` is an array of 0s and 1s, where 1 indicates that the node is part of the maximal independent set and 0 indicates that it is not.

For example, a valid JSON (but not the answer for the example above) would be:
```json
{
    "nodes": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
}
```

Question: In preparation for Passover, five children at Hebrew school (Bernice, Carl, Debby, Sammy, and Ted) have been chosen to present different parts of the story of the Exodus from Egypt (burning bush, captivity, Moses’s youth, Passover, or the Ten Commandments). Each child is a different age (three, five, seven, eight, or ten), and the family of each child has recently made its own exodus to America from a different country (Ethiopia, Kazakhstan, Lithuania, Morocco, or Yemen). Can you find the age of each child, his or her family’s country of origin, and the part of the Exodus story each related?
1. Debby’s family is from Lithuania.
2. The child who told the story of the Passover is two years older than Bernice.
3. The child whose family is from Yemen is younger than the child from the Ethiopian family.
4. The child from the Moroccan family is three years older than Ted.
5. Sammy is three years older than the child who told the story of Moses’s youth in the house of the Pharaoh.
Determine the association: Age-Child-Country-Story.

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:
```json
{
    "ages": [int],
    "children": [int],
    "countries": [int],
    "stories": [int]
}
```
Where each list contains integers from 1 to 5 representing the mapping of the children to the ages, countries, and stories. The numbers should be in the same order as the entities in the question (alphabetical order).

For example, a valid JSON (but not the answer for the example above) would be:

Question: At the hospital n people are on a waiting list for a kidney’s transplant. We have the information about the compatibility between these people as a directed graph: compatible[i] is the set of people to which i can donate. Given this information, we want to maximize the number of people that receive a new kidney: anyone who gives a kidney must receive one, and no person receives more than one kidney. Use the following data:

{
    "num_people": 8,
    "compatible": [  // 1-based index
        [2, 3],
        [1, 6],

        [2],

    ]
}

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:
```json
{
    "transplants": [[0 | 1]]

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:
