Clues:
The person who had the port paid 1 dollar more than Kurt.
Of the person who paid $25 and the person who paid $24, one was Priscilla and the other had the shiraz.
Of the person who paid $27 and Priscilla, one had the chianti and the other had the port.
Isabel paid $25.

Entities:
wines: chianti, port, riesling, shiraz
prices: $24, $25, $26, $27
names: Isabel, Kurt, Priscilla, Robin
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Isabel == 1, and $25 == 1, and Chianti == 1, then Isabel paid $25 for the chianti.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the persons: Isabel, Kurt, Priscilla, Robin (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Prices paid by the persons: Price24, Price25, Price26, Price27 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Wines ordered by the persons: Chianti, Port, Riesling, Shiraz (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The person who had the port paid 1 dollar more than Kurt:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the prices for the person who had the port and Kurt, such that the person who had the port paid 1 dollar more than Kurt. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Port and p2 == Kurt => p1_to_int == p2_to_int + 1, for all p1, p2 in prices.

-   Of the person who paid $25 and the person who paid $24, one was Priscilla and the other had the shiraz:
    This is a constraint that states that for the prices $25 and $24, one is associated with Priscilla and the other with the shiraz, but not both. So:
    Xor([
        (Price25 == Priscilla, Price24 == Shiraz),
        (Price25 == Shiraz, Price24 == Priscilla)
    ]).

-   Of the person who paid $27 and Priscilla, one had the chianti and the other had the port:
    This is a constraint that states that for the prices $27 and Priscilla, one is associated with the chianti and the other with the port, but not both. So:
    Xor([
        (Price27 == Chianti, Priscilla == Port),
        (Price27 == Port, Priscilla == Chianti)
    ]).

-   Isabel paid $25:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Isabel == Price25.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Isabel == 1, and $25 == 1, and Chianti == 1, then Isabel paid $25 for the chianti.

    Xor([
        (Price25 == Priscilla, Price24 == Shiraz),
        (Price25 == Shiraz, Price24 == Priscilla)
    ]).

-   Of the person who paid $27 and Priscilla, one had the chianti and the other had the port:
    This is a constraint that states that for the prices $27 and Priscilla, one is associated with the chianti and the other with the port, but not both. So:
    Xor([
        (Price27 == Chianti, Priscilla == Port),
        (Price27 == Port, Priscilla == Chianti)
    ]).

-   Isabel paid $25:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Isabel == Price25.

The friend who lost 3 pounds used the low-fat diet.
Mandy lost 2 fewer pounds than Raymond.
Mandy lost 4 more pounds than Tom.
The dieter who used the vegan diet is either Mandy or the friend who lost 3 pounds.

Entities:
pounds lost: 3, 5, 7, 9
diets: dairy-free, gluten-free, low-fat, vegan
names: Celia, Mandy, Raymond, Tom
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Celia == 1, and 3pounds == 1, and DairyFree == 1, then Celia used the dairy-free diet and lost 3 pounds.

    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Pounds3 == LowFat.

-   Mandy lost 2 fewer pounds than Raymond:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the pounds lost by Mandy and Raymond, such that Mandy lost 2 fewer pounds than Raymond. So, the constraints will be of the form:

Clues:
The person who will publish in January is either the person who has been studying the Cheer culture or Ira.
The person who has been studying the Xozix culture will publish 1 month before the person who has been studying the Haleyito culture.
Of the student who will publish in March and the person who has been studying the Xozix culture, one is Luther and the other is Yvette.
Vera will publish 1 month before Luther.

Entities:
months: January, February, March, April
names: Ira, Luther, Vera, Yvette
cultures: Cheer, Garyk, Haleyito, Xozix
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Ira == 1, and January == 1, and Cheer == 1, then Ira will publish in January and has been studying the Cheer culture.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the individuals: Ira, Luther, Vera, Yvette (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Months of publication: January, February, March, April (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Cultures studied: Cheer, Garyk, Haleyito, Xozix (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The person who will publish in January is either the person who has been studying the Cheer culture or Ira:
    This is a constraint that states that the person publishing in January is either studying the Cheer culture or is Ira, but not both. So:
    Xor([January == Cheer, January == Ira]).

-   The person who has been studying the Xozix culture will publish 1 month before the person who has been studying the Haleyito culture:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months of publication for the Xozix culture and the Haleyito culture, such that the Xozix culture's publication month is 1 month before the Haleyito culture's publication month. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == Xozix and m2 == Haleyito => m1_to_int == m2_to_int - 1, for all m1, m2 in months of publication.

-   Of the student who will publish in March and the person who has been studying the Xozix culture, one is Luther and the other is Yvette:
    This is a constraint that states that one of Luther or Yvette is studying the Xozix culture and the other will publish in March. So:
    Xor([March == Luther, Xozix == Yvette]).

-   Vera will publish 1 month before Luther:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months of publication for Vera and Luther, such that Vera's publication month is 1 month before Luther's publication month. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == Vera and m2 == Luther => m1_to_int == m2_to_int - 1, for all m1, m2 in months of publication.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Ira == 1, and January == 1, and Cheer == 1, then Ira will publish in January and has been studying the Cheer culture.

-   The person who has been studying the Xozix culture will publish 1 month before the person who has been studying the Haleyito culture:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months of publication for the Xozix culture and the Haleyito culture, such that the Xozix culture's publication month is 1 month before the Haleyito culture's publication month. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == Xozix and m2 == Haleyito => m1_to_int == m2_to_int - 1, for all m1, m2 in months of publication.

-   Of the student who will publish in March and the person who has been studying the Xozix culture, one is Luther and the other is Yvette:
    This is a constraint that states that one of Luther or Yvette is studying the Xozix culture and the other will publish in March. So:
    Xor([March == Luther, Xozix == Yvette]).

-   Vera will publish 1 month before Luther:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months of publication for Vera and Luther, such that Vera's publication month is 1 month before Luther's publication month. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == Vera and m2 == Luther => m1_to_int == m2_to_int - 1, for all m1, m2 in months of publication.

Clues:
The ambassador with the 9 day visit will leave sometime after Fitzgerald.
Quinn will leave 2 months after Bender.
The person leaving in January is either the ambassador with the 3 day visit or Fitzgerald.
Quinn will leave 1 month before the ambassador with the 7 day visit.

Entities:

Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Bender == 1, and January == 1, and Day2 == 1, then Bender is the diplomat leaving in January with a 2-day visit.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the diplomats: Bender, Fitzgerald, Owens, Quinn (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Months of departure: January, February, March, April (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Visit durations: Day2, Day3, Day7, Day9 (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The ambassador with the 9-day visit will leave sometime after Fitzgerald:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months of departure for the ambassador with the 9-day visit and Fitzgerald, such that the ambassador with the 9-day visit's month of departure is greater than Fitzgerald's month of departure. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == Day9 and m2 == Fitzgerald => m1_to_int > m2_to_int, for all m1, m2 in months of departure.

-   Quinn will leave 2 months after Bender:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months of departure for Quinn and Bender, such that Quinn's month of departure is 2 more than Bender's month of departure. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == Quinn and m2 == Bender => m1_to_int == m2_to_int + 2, for all m1, m2 in months of departure.

-   The person leaving in January is either the ambassador with the 3-day visit or Fitzgerald:
    This is a constraint that states that the diplomat leaving in January is either the ambassador with the 3-day visit or Fitzgerald, but not both. So:
    Xor([January == Day3, January == Fitzgerald]).

-   Quinn will leave 1 month before the ambassador with the 7-day visit:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months of departure for Quinn and the ambassador with the 7-day visit, such that Quinn's month of departure is 1 less than the 7-day visit's month of departure. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == Quinn and m2 == Day7 => m1_to_int == m2_to_int - 1, for all m1, m2 in months of departure.

Clues:
Ultra Hex is Gabe Grant.
Criminal Bane is either the hero who started in 2007 or the superhero who started in 2009.
Peter Powers began sometime before Matt Minkle.
Gabe Grant began 1 year after Wonderman.
The four people are Deep Shadow, the superhero who started in 2007, the hero who started in 2009 and Matt Minkle.

Entities:
years: 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010
superheroes: Criminal Bane, Deep Shadow, Ultra Hex, Wonderman
names: Gabe Grant, Ivor Ingram, Matt Minkle, Peter Powers
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same quartet. For example, if DeepShadow == 1, and 2007 == 1, and GabeGrant == 1, then Deep Shadow started in 2007 and is Gabe Grant.

### Decision variables:
-   Start years of the superheroes: Year2007, Year2008, Year2009, Year2010 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Superheroes: CriminalBane, DeepShadow, UltraHex, Wonderman (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Names: GabeGrant, IvorIngram, MattMinkle, PeterPowers (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   Ultra Hex is Gabe Grant:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:

    Xor([CriminalBane == Year2007, CriminalBane == Year2009]).

-   Peter Powers began sometime before Matt Minkle:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the start years for Peter Powers and Matt Minkle, such that Peter Powers started before Matt Minkle. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    y1 == PeterPowers and y2 == MattMinkle => y1_to_int < y2_to_int, for all y1, y2 in years.

-   Gabe Grant began 1 year after Wonderman:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the start years for Gabe Grant and Wonderman, such that Gabe Grant started 1 year after Wonderman. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    y1 == GabeGrant and y2 == Wonderman => y1_to_int == y2_to_int + 1, for all y1, y2 in years.

-   The four people are Deep Shadow, the superhero who started in 2007, the hero who started in 2009, and Matt Minkle:
    This is a constraint that states that all these entities are different, thus:
    AllDifferent([DeepShadow, Year2007, Year2009, MattMinkle]).

Clues:
Of Sophie and Gwen, one will bring their rabbit's foot and the other will leave in January.
Sophie will leave sometime before Gwen.
The passenger with the lucky hat, Gwen and Sophie are all different fliers.
Florence will leave 2 months after the passenger with the lucky hat.
The passenger leaving in April is either Gwen or the passenger with the talisman.

Entities:
months: January, February, March, April
fliers: Florence, Gwen, Olive, Sophie
lucky charms: coin, lucky hat, rabbit's foot, talisman
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Florence == 1, and January == 1, and Coin == 1, then Florence is the passenger leaving in January with the coin.

### Decision variables:
-   Months of departure: January, February, March, April (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Names of the fliers: Florence, Gwen, Olive, Sophie (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Types of lucky charms: Coin, LuckyHat, RabbitsFoot, Talisman (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   Of Sophie and Gwen, one will bring their rabbit's foot and the other will leave in January:
    This is a constraint that states that Sophie's lucky charm is the rabbit's foot and Gwen's month of departure is January, or vice versa. So:
    Xor([Sophie == RabbitsFoot, Gwen == January], [Sophie == January, Gwen == RabbitsFoot]).

-   Sophie will leave sometime before Gwen:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months of departure for Sophie and Gwen, such that Sophie's month of departure is before Gwen's month of departure. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == Sophie and m2 == Gwen => m1_to_int < m2_to_int, for all m1, m2 in months of departure.

-   The passenger with the lucky hat, Gwen, and Sophie are all different fliers:
    This is a constraint that states that the fliers with the lucky hat, Gwen, and Sophie are all different, thus:
    AllDifferent([LuckyHat, Gwen, Sophie]).

-   Florence will leave 2 months after the passenger with the lucky hat:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months of departure for Florence and the passenger with the lucky hat, such that Florence's month of departure is 2 months after the passenger with the lucky hat's month of departure. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == Florence and m2 == LuckyHat => m1_to_int == m2_to_int + 2, for all m1, m2 in months of departure.

-   The passenger leaving in April is either Gwen or the passenger with the talisman:
    This is a constraint that states that the passenger leaving in April is either Gwen or the passenger with the talisman, but not both. So:
    Xor([April == Gwen, April == Talisman]).
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Florence == 1, and January == 1, and Coin == 1, then Florence is the passenger leaving in January with the coin.

-   Of Sophie and Gwen, one will bring their rabbit's foot and the other will leave in January:
    This is a constraint that states that Sophie's lucky charm is the rabbit's foot and Gwen's month of departure is January, or vice versa. So:
    Xor([Sophie == RabbitsFoot, Gwen == January], [Sophie == January, Gwen == RabbitsFoot]).

-   Sophie will leave sometime before Gwen:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months of departure for Sophie and Gwen, such that Sophie's month of departure is before Gwen's month of departure. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == Sophie and m2 == Gwen => m1_to_int < m2_to_int, for all m1, m2 in months of departure.

-   The passenger with the lucky hat, Gwen, and Sophie are all different fliers:
    This is a constraint that states that the fliers with the lucky hat, Gwen, and Sophie are all different, thus:
    AllDifferent([LuckyHat, Gwen, Sophie]).

-   Florence will leave 2 months after the passenger with the lucky hat:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months of departure for Florence and the passenger with the lucky hat, such that Florence's month of departure is 2 months after the passenger with the lucky hat's month of departure. So, the constraints will be of the form:

    This is a constraint that states that the passenger leaving in April is either Gwen or the passenger with the talisman, but not both. So:

The Iunsel launched in February.
The Munei is going to Mars.
The Munei launched 1 month after the mission going to Pluto.
Of the mission going to Ganymede and the mission going to Pluto, one launched in March and the other is the Chano.

Entities:
months: January, February, March, April
probes: Ateyin, Chano, Iunsel, Munei
destinations: Ganymede, Mars, Pluto, Uranus
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Ateyin == 1, and January == 1, and Ganymede == 1, then Ateyin is the probe going to Ganymede and will launch in January.

-   The Munei is going to Mars:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Munei == Mars.

-   The Munei launched 1 month after the mission going to Pluto:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months of launch for the Munei and the mission going to Pluto, such that Munei's month of launch is 1 month after the mission going to Pluto's month of launch. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == Munei and m2 == Pluto => m1_to_int == m2_to_int + 1, for all m1, m2 in months of launch.

-   Of the mission going to Ganymede and the mission going to Pluto, one launched in March and the other is the Chano:
    This is a constraint that states that for the mission going to Ganymede and the mission going to Pluto, one launched in March and the other is Chano, but not both. So:
    Xor([
        (Ganymede == March, Pluto == Chano),

### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing.

-   Of the mission going to Ganymede and the mission going to Pluto, one launched in March and the other is the Chano:
    This is a constraint that states that for the mission going to Ganymede and the mission going to Pluto, one launched in March and the other is Chano, but not both. So:

Clues:
The blue topaz sold for 10 dollars more than the gem found in the Osborne claim.
The rhodolite went for $820.
The tourmaline is either the gem that sold for $810 or the gem found in the Underwood claim.
Of the gem found in the Collins claim and the aquamarine, one went for $790 and the other went for $800.

Entities:
prices: $790, $800, $810, $820
gems: aquamarine, blue topaz, rhodolite, tourmaline
claims: Collins, Knox, Osborne, Underwood
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if $790 == 1, and Aquamarine == 1, and Collins == 1, then the gem found in the Collins claim went for $790 and is an aquamarine.

### Decision variables:

-   Types of gems: Aquamarine, BlueTopaz, Rhodolite, Tourmaline (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Claims where gems were found: Collins, Knox, Osborne, Underwood (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The blue topaz sold for 10 dollars more than the gem found in the Osborne claim:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the prices for the blue topaz and the gem found in the Osborne claim, such that the blue topaz's price is 10 dollars more than the gem found in the Osborne claim. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == BlueTopaz and p2 == Osborne => p1_to_int == p2_to_int + 10, for all p1, p2 in prices.

-   The rhodolite went for $820:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Rhodolite == $820.

-   The tourmaline is either the gem that sold for $810 or the gem found in the Underwood claim:
    This is a constraint that states that the tourmaline's price is either $810 or the tourmaline was found in the Underwood claim. So:
    Xor([Tourmaline == $810, Tourmaline == Underwood]).

-   Of the gem found in the Collins claim and the aquamarine, one went for $790 and the other went for $800:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the prices for the gem found in the Collins claim and the aquamarine, such that one went for $790 and the other went for $800. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Collins and p2 == Aquamarine => (p1_to_int == $790 and p2_to_int == $800) or (p1_to_int == $800 and p2_to_int == $790), for all p1, p2 in prices.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if $790 == 1, and Aquamarine == 1, and Collins == 1, then the gem found in the Collins claim went for $790 and is an aquamarine.

    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Rhodolite == $820.

-   The tourmaline is either the gem that sold for $810 or the gem found in the Underwood claim:
    This is a constraint that states that the tourmaline's price is either $810 or the tourmaline was found in the Underwood claim. So:

Clues:
Of the anniversary event and the event with 100 attendees, one will be handled by Joel and the other will be handled by Susan.
Herbert's assignment will involve 25 fewer people than Susan's assignment.
Of the assignment with 75 attendees and the assignment with 100 attendees, one will be handled by Susan and the other is the birthday.
Herbert's event is either the event with 50 attendees or the graduation job.

Entities:
people: 50, 75, 100, 125
planners: Herbert, Joel, Susan, Teresa
events: anniversary, birthday, graduation, wedding
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Herbert == 1, and 50 == 1, and Anniversary == 1, then Herbert's assignment involves the anniversary event with 50 attendees.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the planners: Herbert, Joel, Susan, Teresa (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Number of people attending the events: People50, People75, People100, People125 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Types of events: Anniversary, Birthday, Graduation, Wedding (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   Of the anniversary event and the event with 100 attendees, one will be handled by Joel and the other will be handled by Susan:
    This is a constraint that states that for the anniversary event and the event with 100 attendees, one is handled by Joel and the other by Susan, but not both. So:
    Xor([
        (Anniversary == Joel, People100 == Susan),
        (Anniversary == Susan, People100 == Joel)
    ]).

-   Herbert's assignment will involve 25 fewer people than Susan's assignment:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the number of people attending Herbert's event and Susan's event, such that Herbert's event involves 25 fewer people than Susan's event. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Herbert and p2 == Susan => p1_to_int == p2_to_int - 25, for all p1, p2 in people.

-   Of the assignment with 75 attendees and the assignment with 100 attendees, one will be handled by Susan and the other is the birthday:
    This is a constraint that states that for the assignment with 75 attendees and the assignment with 100 attendees, one is handled by Susan and the other is the birthday event, but not both. So:
    Xor([
        (People75 == Susan, People100 == Birthday),
        (People75 == Birthday, People100 == Susan)
    ]).

-   Herbert's event is either the event with 50 attendees or the graduation event:
    This is a constraint that states that Herbert's event is either the event with 50 attendees or the graduation event, but not both. So:
    Xor([People50 == Herbert, Graduation == Herbert]).
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Herbert == 1, and 50 == 1, and Anniversary == 1, then Herbert's assignment involves the anniversary event with 50 attendees.

        (People75 == Birthday, People100 == Susan)
    ]).

-   Herbert's event is either the event with 50 attendees or the graduation event:
    This is a constraint that states that Herbert's event is either the event with 50 attendees or the graduation event, but not both. So:

Clues:
D. forcilitis has 500 genes.
B. mangeris was either the one sequenced by Dr. Ortiz or the organism with 750 genes.
The organism sequenced by Dr. Trujillo has 500 more genes than the bacteria sequenced by Dr. Nielsen.
Of the bacteria sequenced by Dr. Jordan and the bacteria sequenced by Dr. Trujillo, one has 1000 genes and the other is E. carolinus.

Entities:
genes: 250, 500, 750, 1000
bacteria: B. mangeris, D. forcilitis, E. carolinus, P. wellington
doctors: Jordan, Nielsen, Ortiz, Trujillo
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Dforcilitis == 1, and 500 == 1, and Jordan == 1, then D. forcilitis has 500 genes and was sequenced by Dr. Jordan.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the bacteria: Bmangeris, Dforcilitis, Ecarolinus, Pwellington (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Number of genes: Genes250, Genes500, Genes750, Genes1000 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Doctors: Jordan, Nielsen, Ortiz, Trujillo (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   D. forcilitis has 500 genes:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Dforcilitis == Genes500.

-   B. mangeris was either the one sequenced by Dr. Ortiz or the organism with 750 genes:
    This is a constraint that states that B. mangeris was either sequenced by Dr. Ortiz or has 750 genes, but not both. So:
    Xor([Bmangeris == Ortiz, Bmangeris == Genes750]).

-   The organism sequenced by Dr. Trujillo has 500 more genes than the bacteria sequenced by Dr. Nielsen:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the number of genes for the organism sequenced by Dr. Trujillo and the bacteria sequenced by Dr. Nielsen, such that the organism sequenced by Dr. Trujillo has 500 more genes than the bacteria sequenced by Dr. Nielsen. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    g1 == Trujillo and g2 == Nielsen => g1_to_int == g2_to_int + 500, for all g1, g2 in number of genes.

-   Of the bacteria sequenced by Dr. Jordan and the bacteria sequenced by Dr. Trujillo, one has 1000 genes and the other is E. carolinus:
    This is a constraint that states that one of the bacteria sequenced by Dr. Jordan and Dr. Trujillo has 1000 genes and the other is E. carolinus, but not both. So:
    Xor([Jordan == Genes1000, Jordan == Ecarolinus]).
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Dforcilitis == 1, and 500 == 1, and Jordan == 1, then D. forcilitis has 500 genes and was sequenced by Dr. Jordan.

Clues:
Opie Oliver's card came out in 2012.
The piece that sold for $175 came out in 1999.
Of the 2012 card and the 1987 item, one featured Mike Morales and the other sold for $275.
Neddy Norris's item sold for 50 dollars more than the 1987 card.

players: Finn Freeman, Mike Morales, Neddy Norris, Opie Oliver
years: 1974, 1987, 1999, 2012
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if OpieOliver == 1, and 2012 == 1, and $125 == 1, then Opie Oliver's card came out in 2012 and sold for $125.

### Decision variables:

-   Prices of the items: $125, $175, $225, $275 (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   Opie Oliver's card came out in 2012:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    OpieOliver == Year2012.

-   The piece that sold for $175 came out in 1999:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    $175 == Year1999.

-   Of the 2012 card and the 1987 item, one featured Mike Morales and the other sold for $275:
    This is a constraint that states that for the 2012 card and the 1987 item, one featured Mike Morales and the other sold for $275, but not both. So:
    Xor([
        (Year2012 == MikeMorales, $275 == Year1987),
        (Year2012 == $275, Year1987 == MikeMorales)

-   Neddy Norris's item sold for 50 dollars more than the 1987 card:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the prices for Neddy Norris's item and the 1987 card, such that Neddy Norris's item sold for $50 more than the 1987 card. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == NeddyNorris and p2 == Year1987 => p1_to_int == p2_to_int + 50, for all p1, p2 in prices.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if OpieOliver == 1, and 2012 == 1, and $125 == 1, then Opie Oliver's card came out in 2012 and sold for $125.

-   Of the 2012 card and the 1987 item, one featured Mike Morales and the other sold for $275:
    This is a constraint that states that for the 2012 card and the 1987 item, one featured Mike Morales and the other sold for $275, but not both. So:
    Xor([
        (Year2012 == MikeMorales, $275 == Year1987),
        (Year2012 == $275, Year1987 == MikeMorales)
    ]).

-   Neddy Norris's item sold for 50 dollars more than the 1987 card:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the prices for Neddy Norris's item and the 1987 card, such that Neddy Norris's item sold for $50 more than the 1987 card. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == NeddyNorris and p2 == Year1987 => p1_to_int == p2_to_int + 50, for all p1, p2 in prices.

Clues:
Of Nelson and the cook who scored 63 points, one made the lemon snapper and the other made the cajun chili.
Of the chef who scored 42 points and the cook who scored 63 points, one made the cashew tofu and the other was Rosalie.
Karl scored 7 more points than the person who made the lemon snapper.

Entities:
scores: 42, 49, 56, 63
chefs: Karl, Nelson, Peggy, Rosalie
dishes: cajun chili, cashew tofu, lemon snapper, smoked pork
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Karl == 1, and 42 == 1, and CajunChili == 1, then Karl scored 42 points and made the cajun chili.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the chefs: Karl, Nelson, Peggy, Rosalie (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Scores of the chefs: Score42, Score49, Score56, Score63 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Dishes made: CajunChili, CashewTofu, LemonSnapper, SmokedPork (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   Of Nelson and the cook who scored 63 points, one made the lemon snapper and the other made the cajun chili:
    This is a constraint that states that for Nelson and the cook who scored 63 points, one made the lemon snapper and the other made the cajun chili, but not both. So:

-   Of the chef who scored 42 points and the cook who scored 63 points, one made the cashew tofu and the other was Rosalie:
    This is a constraint that states that for the chef who scored 42 points and the cook who scored 63 points, one made the cashew tofu and the other was Rosalie, but not both. So:
    Xor([
        (Score42 == CashewTofu, Score63 == Rosalie),
        (Score42 == Rosalie, Score63 == CashewTofu)
    ]).

-   Karl scored 7 more points than the person who made the lemon snapper:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the scores for Karl and the person who made the lemon snapper, such that Karl's score is 7 more points than the person who made the lemon snapper. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    s1 == Karl and s2 == LemonSnapper => s1_to_int == s2_to_int + 7, for all s1, s2 in scores.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Karl == 1, and 42 == 1, and CajunChili == 1, then Karl scored 42 points and made the cajun chili.

### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Alejandro == 1, and $75 == 1, and Atlas == 1, then Alejandro purchased the atlas butterfly for $75.

### Decision variables:

### Constraints:
-   Alejandro's purchase cost less than Irma's purchase:

-   The insect that sold for $90 was either the atlas butterfly or the emperor butterfly:
    This is a constraint that states that the butterfly that sold for $90 is either the atlas butterfly or the emperor butterfly, but not both. So:

-   The peacock butterfly cost more than Irma's purchase:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the prices for the peacock butterfly and Irma's purchase, such that the peacock butterfly cost more than Irma's purchase. So, the constraints will be of the form:

-   The four butterflies were Phillip's purchase, the insect that sold for $60, the butterfly that sold for $45, and the butterfly that sold for $90:
    This is a constraint that states that all these entities are different, thus:

rowers: Antonio, Dana, Hilda, Walter
start points: Bodega Bay, Cayucos, Pescadero, Pismo Beach
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Antonio == 1, and 184days == 1, and BodegaBay == 1, then Antonio traveled for 184 days starting from Bodega Bay.

-   Of Dana and the athlete who traveled for 184 days, one started from Cayucos and the other started from Bodega Bay:
    This is a constraint that states that Dana's start point is either Cayucos or Dana traveled for 184 days starting from Bodega Bay, but not both. So:

-   Hilda finished in 217 days:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:

-   Walter finished 11 days before the athlete who started from Cayucos:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the durations for Walter and the athlete who started from Cayucos, such that Walter's duration is 11 days less than the athlete who started from Cayucos. So, the constraints will be of the form:

    This is a constraint that states that Dana's start point is either Cayucos or Dana traveled for 184 days starting from Bodega Bay, but not both. So:
    Xor([Dana == Cayucos, Dana == BodegaBay]).

-   Hilda finished in 217 days:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Days217 == Hilda.

-   Walter finished 11 days before the athlete who started from Cayucos:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the durations for Walter and the athlete who started from Cayucos, such that Walter's duration is 11 days less than the athlete who started from Cayucos. So, the constraints will be of the form:

    e1 == KennethKey and e2 == Amerigo => e1_to_int == e2_to_int - 3, for all e1, e2 in earnings.

-   Fast and Dead was directed by Kenneth Key:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    FastAndDead == KennethKey.

-   Let Me Out is either the movie directed by Linda Lynch or the movie that grossed 5 million:
    This is a constraint that states that Let Me Out is either directed by Linda Lynch or grossed 5 million, but not both. So:
    Xor([LetMeOut == LindaLynch, LetMeOut == 5 million]).
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Amerigo == 1, and 2 million == 1, and JimJohnson == 1, then Amerigo made 2 million and was directed by Jim Johnson.

### Decision variables:
-   Earnings of the movies: 2 million, 5 million, 8 million, 11 million (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Names of the movies: Amerigo, FastAndDead, LetMeOut, WhatAWorld (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Directors of the movies: JimJohnson, KennethKey, LindaLynch, MicahMoreno (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The movie that grossed 5 million was directed by Kenneth Key:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    5 million == KennethKey.

-   Of What a World and Amerigo, one made 2 million and the other was directed by Jim Johnson:
    This is a constraint that states that for What a World and Amerigo, one made 2 million and the other was directed by Jim Johnson, but not both. So:
    Xor([
        (WhatAWorld == 2 million, Amerigo == JimJohnson),
        (WhatAWorld == JimJohnson, Amerigo == 2 million)
    ]).

states: Connecticut, Missouri, New Mexico, Texas
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Arlene == 1, and Age109 == 1, and Connecticut == 1, then Arlene is 109 years old and is a native of Connecticut.

-   Of Arlene and the Texas native, one is 110 years old and the other is 109 years old:
    This is a constraint that states that for Arlene and the Texas native, one is 110 years old and the other is 109 years old, but not both. So:
    Xor([

    ]).

-   Herbert is 1 year younger than Doris:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the ages for Herbert and Doris, such that Herbert's age is 1 year less than Doris's age. So, the constraints will be of the form:

    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the prices for the one who had the port and Kurt, such that the port's price is 2 dollars more than Kurt's price. So, the constraints will be of the form:

-   Of El Pacifico and Regal Park, one is on Martinique and the other costs $175 per night:
    This is a constraint that states that El Pacifico is on Martinique and costs $175 per night, and Regal Park is the opposite. So:

-   Species of the tortoises: BlackNeck, Horned, PitchBelly, Swoopbacked (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   Snappy is 18 years younger than the swoopbacked tortoise:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the ages for Snappy and the swoopbacked tortoise, such that Snappy's age is 18 years less than the swoopbacked tortoise's age. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    a1 == Snappy and a2 == Swoopbacked => a1_to_int == a2_to_int - 18, for all a1, a2 in ages.

-   The 68 year old animal is the horned tortoise:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Age68 == Horned.

-   Chewie is 32 years old:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Chewie == Age32.

-   Of Snappy and Toredo, one is 14 years old and the other is the horned tortoise:
    This is a constraint that states that for Snappy and Toredo, one is 14 years old and the other is the horned tortoise, but not both. So:
    Xor([
        (Snappy == Age14, Toredo == Horned),
        (Snappy == Horned, Toredo == Age14)
    ]).

-   The pitch belly tortoise is younger than Chewie:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the ages for the pitch belly tortoise and Chewie, such that the pitch belly tortoise's age is less than Chewie's age. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    a1 == PitchBelly and a2 == Chewie => a1_to_int < a2_to_int, for all a1, a2 in ages.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Chewie == 1, and Age32 == 1, and BlackNeck == 1, then Chewie is 32 years old and is a black neck tortoise.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the tortoises: Chewie, Snappy, Speedy, Toredo (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Ages of the tortoises: Age14, Age32, Age50, Age68 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Species of the tortoises: BlackNeck, Horned, PitchBelly, Swoopbacked (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   Snappy is 18 years younger than the swoopbacked tortoise:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the ages for Snappy and the swoopbacked tortoise, such that Snappy's age is 18 years less than the swoopbacked tortoise's age. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    a1 == Snappy and a2 == Swoopbacked => a1_to_int == a2_to_int - 18, for all a1, a2 in ages.

-   The 68 year old animal is the horned tortoise:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Age68 == Horned.

-   Chewie is 32 years old:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Chewie == Age32.

-   Of Snappy and Toredo, one is 14 years old and the other is the horned tortoise:
    This is a constraint that states that for Snappy and Toredo, one is 14 years old and the other is the horned tortoise, but not both. So:
    Xor([
        (Snappy == Age14, Toredo == Horned),
        (Snappy == Horned, Toredo == Age14)
    ]).

-   The pitch belly tortoise is younger than Chewie:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the ages for the pitch belly tortoise and Chewie, such that the pitch belly tortoise's age is less than Chewie's age. So, the constraints will be of the form:

    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months of purchase for Natalie's pet and Roberta's pet, such that Natalie's pet was bought before Roberta's pet. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == Natalie and m2 == Roberta => m1_to_int < m2_to_int, for all m1, m2 in months of purchase.

-   Laura's pet is the lovebird:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Laura == Lovebird.

-   The bird bought in February is either the lorikeet or the lovebird:

    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Friambliss == Syrah.

Clues:
Hannah paid more than Teri's client.
Freda paid 20 dollars more than Lynda's client.
Hannah paid 10 dollars less than Nancy's client.
Nancy's client, Hannah and Ginger were all different clients.
Hannah was either the person who paid $180 or Lynda's client.

Entities:
Clients: Aimee, Ginger, Freda, Hannah
Prices: $150, $160, $170, $180
Masseuses: Lynda, Nancy, Teri, Whitney
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Aimee == 1, and Price150 == 1, and Lynda == 1, then Aimee paid $150 to Lynda.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the clients: Aimee, Ginger, Freda, Hannah (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Prices paid by the clients: Price150, Price160, Price170, Price180 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Names of the masseuses: Lynda, Nancy, Teri, Whitney (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   Hannah paid more than Teri's client:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of prices to Hannah and Teri's client, such that Hannah's price is greater than Teri's client's price. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Hannah and p2 == Teri => p1_to_int > p2_to_int, for all p1, p2 in prices.

-   Freda paid 20 dollars more than Lynda's client:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of prices to Freda and Lynda's client, such that Freda's price is 20 dollars greater than Lynda's client's price. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Freda and p2 == Lynda => p1_to_int == p2_to_int + 20, for all p1, p2 in prices.

-   Hannah paid 10 dollars less than Nancy's client:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of prices to Hannah and Nancy's client, such that Hannah's price is 10 dollars less than Nancy's client's price. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Hannah and p2 == Nancy => p1_to_int == p2_to_int - 10, for all p1, p2 in prices.

-   Nancy's client, Hannah and Ginger were all different clients:
    This is a constraint that states that all these entities are different, thus:
    AllDifferent([Nancy, Hannah, Ginger]).

-   Hannah was either the person who paid $180 or Lynda's client:
    This is a constraint that states that Hannah is either the person who paid $180 or Lynda's client, but not both. Thus:
    Xor([Hannah == Price180, Hannah == Lynda]).

    This is a constraint that states that Hannah is either the person who paid $180 or Lynda's client, but not both. Thus:

Clues:
Evan played 9 games.
Vincent played first base.
The player who played third base played 2 more games than the person who played center field.
Charles played 2 more games than the player who played center field.
Charles was either the boy who played 9 games or the person who played 10 games.

Entities:
players: Charles, Evan, Karl, Vincent
games: 8, 9, 10, 11
positions: center field, first base, shortstop, third base
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Charles == 1, and Games9 == 1, and ThirdBase == 1, then Charles played 9 games and played third base.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the players: Charles, Evan, Karl, Vincent (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Number of games played: Games8, Games9, Games10, Games11 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Positions played: CenterField, FirstBase, Shortstop, ThirdBase (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   Evan played 9 games:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Evan == Games9.

-   Vincent played first base:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Vincent == FirstBase.

-   The player who played third base played 2 more games than the person who played center field:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the number of games for the player who played third base and the player who played center field, such that the third base player's games are 2 more than the center field player's games. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    g1 == ThirdBase and g2 == CenterField => g1_to_int == g2_to_int + 2, for all g1, g2 in games.

-   Charles played 2 more games than the player who played center field:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the number of games for Charles and the player who played center field, such that Charles's games are 2 more than the center field player's games. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    g1 == Charles and g2 == CenterField => g1_to_int == g2_to_int + 2, for all g1, g2 in games.

-   Charles was either the boy who played 9 games or the person who played 10 games:
    This is a constraint that states that Charles's number of games is either 9 or 10, but not both. So:
    Xor([Charles == Games9, Charles == Games10]).
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Charles == 1, and Games9 == 1, and ThirdBase == 1, then Charles played 9 games and played third base.

    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the number of games for the player who played third base and the player who played center field, such that the third base player's games are 2 more than the center field player's games. So, the constraints will be of the form:

Clues:
Ingram had 7 goals this season.
The four players are Underwood, the player from the Ice Hogs, the player from the Monsters and the player from the Checkers.
Parrish scored 1 goal more than Quinn.
The player with 9 goals is from the Ice Hogs.
Ingram is either the player from the Checkers or the player with 6 goals.

Entities:
players: Ingram, Parrish, Quinn, Underwood
goals: 6, 7, 8, 9
teams: Checkers, Comets, Ice Hogs, Monsters
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Ingram == 1, and Goals7 == 1, and Checkers == 1, then Ingram scored 7 goals this season and is from the Checkers.

### Decision variables:

-   Number of goals scored: Goals6, Goals7, Goals8, Goals9 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Names of the teams: Checkers, Comets, IceHogs, Monsters (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   Ingram had 7 goals this season:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Ingram == Goals7.

-   The four players are Underwood, the player from the Ice Hogs, the player from the Monsters, and the player from the Checkers:
    This is a constraint that states that all these entities are different, thus:
    AllDifferent([Underwood, IceHogs, Monsters, Checkers]).

-   Parrish scored 1 goal more than Quinn:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the number of goals for Parrish and Quinn, such that Parrish's number of goals is 1 more than Quinn's number of goals. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    g1 == Parrish and g2 == Quinn => g1_to_int == g2_to_int + 1, for all g1, g2 in goals.

-   The player with 9 goals is from the Ice Hogs:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Goals9 == IceHogs.

-   Ingram is either the player from the Checkers or the player with 6 goals:
    This is a constraint that states that Ingram's team is either the Checkers or Ingram's number of goals is 6, but not both. So:
    Xor([Ingram == Checkers, Ingram == Goals6]).
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Ingram == 1, and Goals7 == 1, and Checkers == 1, then Ingram scored 7 goals this season and is from the Checkers.

-   Parrish scored 1 goal more than Quinn:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the number of goals for Parrish and Quinn, such that Parrish's number of goals is 1 more than Quinn's number of goals. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    g1 == Parrish and g2 == Quinn => g1_to_int == g2_to_int + 1, for all g1, g2 in goals.

-   The player with 9 goals is from the Ice Hogs:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Goals9 == IceHogs.

-   Ingram is either the player from the Checkers or the player with 6 goals:
    This is a constraint that states that Ingram's team is either the Checkers or Ingram's number of goals is 6, but not both. So:

Clues:
The variety that requires 190 degree water costs 1 dollar less than the variety that requires 195 degree water.
The Pouchong costs 1 dollar less than the Red Robe.
The Pouchong needs 195 degree water.
The four teas are the Ali Shan, the variety that costs $6, the variety that requires 200 degree water and the tea that requires 190 degree water.

Entities:
teas: Ali Shan, Jin Xuan, Pouchong, Red Robe
prices: $4, $5, $6, $7
temperatures: 190 degree, 195 degree, 200 degree, 215 degree
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if AliShan == 1, and $4 == 1, and 190degree == 1, then Ali Shan costs $4 and requires 190-degree water.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the teas: Ali Shan, Jin Xuan, Pouchong, Red Robe (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Prices of the teas: Price4, Price5, Price6, Price7 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Water temperatures required: 190 degree, 195 degree, 200 degree, 215 degree (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The variety that requires 190 degree water costs 1 dollar less than the variety that requires 195 degree water:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the prices for the teas that require 190 and 195 degree water, such that the tea requiring 190 degree water costs 1 dollar less than the tea requiring 195 degree water. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == 190degree and p2 == 195degree => p1_to_int == p2_to_int - 1, for all p1, p2 in prices.

-   The Pouchong costs 1 dollar less than the Red Robe:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the prices for the Pouchong and the Red Robe, such that the Pouchong costs 1 dollar less than the Red Robe. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Pouchong and p2 == RedRobe => p1_to_int == p2_to_int - 1, for all p1, p2 in prices.

-   The Pouchong needs 195 degree water:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Pouchong == 195degree.

-   The four teas are the Ali Shan, the variety that costs $6, the variety that requires 200 degree water, and the tea that requires 190 degree water:
    This is a constraint that states that all these entities are different, thus:
    AllDifferent([AliShan, Price6, 200degree, 190degree]).
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if AliShan == 1, and $4 == 1, and 190degree == 1, then Ali Shan costs $4 and requires 190-degree water.

    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the prices for the Pouchong and the Red Robe, such that the Pouchong costs 1 dollar less than the Red Robe. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Pouchong and p2 == RedRobe => p1_to_int == p2_to_int - 1, for all p1, p2 in prices.

Clues:
The flier leaving in April will bring shamrock.
The passenger with the rabbit's foot will leave 1 month after Troy.
The flier with the horseshoe will leave 1 month after Doug.
The flier with the horseshoe is either Peggy or the passenger leaving in January.

Entities:
fliers: Doug, Eloise, Peggy, Troy
months: January, February, March, April
lucky charms: coin, horseshoe, rabbit's foot, shamrock
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Doug == 1, and January == 1, and Coin == 1, then Doug is the flier leaving in January with the coin.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the fliers: Doug, Eloise, Peggy, Troy (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Months of departure: January, February, March, April (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The flier leaving in April will bring shamrock:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    April == Shamrock.

-   The passenger with the rabbit's foot will leave 1 month after Troy:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months of departure for the passenger with the rabbit's foot and Troy, such that the rabbit's foot's month of departure is 1 more than Troy's month of departure. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == RabbitsFoot and m2 == Troy => m1_to_int == m2_to_int + 1, for all m1, m2 in months of departure.

-   The flier with the horseshoe will leave 1 month after Doug:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months of departure for the flier with the horseshoe and Doug, such that the horseshoe's month of departure is 1 more than Doug's month of departure. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == Horseshoe and m2 == Doug => m1_to_int == m2_to_int + 1, for all m1, m2 in months of departure.

-   The flier with the horseshoe is either Peggy or the passenger leaving in January:
    This is a constraint that states that the flier with the horseshoe is either Peggy or the passenger leaving in January, but not both. So:
    Xor([Horseshoe == Peggy, January == Horseshoe]).
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Doug == 1, and January == 1, and Coin == 1, then Doug is the flier leaving in January with the coin.

Yolanda's sandwich costs 2 dollars less than the order with swiss cheese.

Entities:
customers: Lula, Ronda, Sue, Yolanda
prices: $2, $3, $4, $5
cheeses: cheddar, havarti, muenster, swiss
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Ronda == 1, and $5 == 1, and Havarti == 1, then Ronda's sandwich costs $5 and has havarti cheese.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the customers: Lula, Ronda, Sue, Yolanda (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Prices of the orders: Price2, Price3, Price4, Price5 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Cheeses in the sandwiches: Cheddar, Havarti, Muenster, Swiss (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   Ronda's sandwich and the sandwich with havarti cheese are different sandwiches:
    This is a constraint that states that Ronda's sandwich and the sandwich with havarti cheese are different. So, we need to ensure that the cheeses and the customers are different for these two sandwiches:
    AllDifferent([Ronda, Havarti]).

-   Ronda's order costs $5:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Ronda == $5.

-   Lula's order is either the $3 sandwich or the order that costs $5:
    This is a constraint that states that Lula's order is either $3 or $5. So, we need to ensure that Lula's order is either $3 or $5:
    Or(Lula == $3, Lula == $5).

-   The sandwich with cheddar cheese costs less than the order with havarti cheese:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the prices for the sandwich with cheddar cheese and the sandwich with havarti cheese, such that the cheddar cheese's order costs less than the havarti cheese's order. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Cheddar and p2 == Havarti => p1_to_int < p2_to_int, for all p1, p2 in prices.

-   Yolanda's sandwich costs 2 dollars less than the order with swiss cheese:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the prices for Yolanda's sandwich and the sandwich with swiss cheese, such that Yolanda's sandwich costs 2 dollars less than the swiss cheese's order. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Yolanda and p2 == Swiss => p1_to_int == p2_to_int - 2, for all p1, p2 in prices.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Ronda == 1, and $5 == 1, and Havarti == 1, then Ronda's sandwich costs $5 and has havarti cheese.

### Constraints:
-   The rocket developed by Vexatech will launch 1 month after the Exatris:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months of launch for the rocket developed by Vexatech and the Exatris, such that Vexatech's rocket will launch 1 month after the Exatris. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == Vexatech and m2 == Exatris => m1_to_int == m2_to_int + 1, for all m1, m2 in months of launch.

-   The rocket developed by SpaceZen will launch sometime after the Beritron:

Entities:

majors: Biology, Mathematics, Physics, Theology
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same quartet. For example, if Anna == 1, and Scholarship25000 == 1, and Biology == 1, then Anna received a $25000 scholarship and will major in Biology.

### Constraints:
-   The student who will major in Physics was awarded $5000 less than the student who will major in Biology:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of scholarships to the students majoring in Physics and Biology, such that the Physics student's scholarship is $5000 less than the Biology student's scholarship. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    s1 == Physics and s2 == Biology => s1_to_int == s2_to_int - 5000, for all s1, s2 in scholarships.

-   Wilma will major in Mathematics:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:

    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of scholarships to Delores and Anna, such that Delores's scholarship is $5000 more than Anna's scholarship. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    s1 == Delores and s2 == Anna => s1_to_int == s2_to_int + 5000, for all s1, s2 in scholarships.

-   Anna was awarded some amount less than the person who will major in Mathematics:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of scholarships to Anna and the person majoring in Mathematics, such that Anna's scholarship is less than the Mathematics student's scholarship. So, the constraints will be of the form:

Clues:
The four butterflies were the swallowtail butterfly, Rena's purchase, the insect that sold for $90, and Phillip's purchase.

Brandon's purchase cost 30 dollars less than Otis's purchase.
Rena's purchase cost 15 dollars less than the swallowtail butterfly.
The insect that sold for $75 was the torturix butterfly.

Entities:
winners: Brandon, Otis, Phillip, Rena

butterflies: peacock, peppered, swallowtail, torturix
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Brandon == 1, and $45 == 1, and Peacock == 1, then Brandon's purchase was the peacock butterfly and cost $45.

### Decision variables:

-   Prices of the butterflies: Price45, Price60, Price75, Price90 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Types of butterflies: Peacock, Peppered, Swallowtail, Torturix (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The four butterflies were the swallowtail butterfly, Rena's purchase, the insect that sold for $90, and Phillip's purchase:
    This is a constraint that states that all these entities are different, thus:
    AllDifferent([Swallowtail, Rena, Price90, Phillip]).

-   Otis's purchase was either the peacock butterfly or the swallowtail butterfly:
    This is a constraint that states that Otis's purchase is either the peacock butterfly or the swallowtail butterfly, but not both. So:
    Xor([Otis == Peacock, Otis == Swallowtail]).

-   Brandon's purchase cost 30 dollars less than Otis's purchase:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the prices for Brandon's purchase and Otis's purchase, such that Brandon's purchase cost is 30 dollars less than Otis's purchase cost. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Brandon and p2 == Otis => p1_to_int == p2_to_int - 30, for all p1, p2 in prices.

-   Rena's purchase cost 15 dollars less than the swallowtail butterfly:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the prices for Rena's purchase and the swallowtail butterfly, such that Rena's purchase cost is 15 dollars less than the swallowtail butterfly's cost. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Rena and p2 == Swallowtail => p1_to_int == p2_to_int - 15, for all p1, p2 in prices.

-   The insect that sold for $75 was the torturix butterfly:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Torturix == Price75.
### Plan:

    This is a constraint that states that all these entities are different, thus:
    AllDifferent([Swallowtail, Rena, Price90, Phillip]).

-   Otis's purchase was either the peacock butterfly or the swallowtail butterfly:
    This is a constraint that states that Otis's purchase is either the peacock butterfly or the swallowtail butterfly, but not both. So:
    Xor([Otis == Peacock, Otis == Swallowtail]).

-   Brandon's purchase cost 30 dollars less than Otis's purchase:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the prices for Brandon's purchase and Otis's purchase, such that Brandon's purchase cost is 30 dollars less than Otis's purchase cost. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Brandon and p2 == Otis => p1_to_int == p2_to_int - 30, for all p1, p2 in prices.

-   Rena's purchase cost 15 dollars less than the swallowtail butterfly:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the prices for Rena's purchase and the swallowtail butterfly, such that Rena's purchase cost is 15 dollars less than the swallowtail butterfly's cost. So, the constraints will be of the form:

Clues:
The ambassador with the 9 day visit will leave sometime after Fitzgerald.
Quinn will leave 2 months after Bender.
The person leaving in January is either the ambassador with the 3 day visit or Fitzgerald.
Quinn will leave 1 month before the ambassador with the 7 day visit.

Entities:
diplomats: Bender, Fitzgerald, Owens, Quinn
months: January, February, March, April
durations: 2 day, 3 day, 7 day, 9 day
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Bender == 1, and January == 1, and Day2 == 1, then Bender is the diplomat leaving in January with a 2-day visit.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the diplomats: Bender, Fitzgerald, Owens, Quinn (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Months of departure: January, February, March, April (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Visit durations: Day2, Day3, Day7, Day9 (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The ambassador with the 9-day visit will leave sometime after Fitzgerald:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months of departure for the ambassador with the 9-day visit and Fitzgerald, such that the ambassador with the 9-day visit's month of departure is greater than Fitzgerald's month of departure. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == Day9 and m2 == Fitzgerald => m1_to_int > m2_to_int, for all m1, m2 in months of departure.

-   Quinn will leave 2 months after Bender:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months of departure for Quinn and Bender, such that Quinn's month of departure is 2 more than Bender's month of departure. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == Quinn and m2 == Bender => m1_to_int == m2_to_int + 2, for all m1, m2 in months of departure.

-   The person leaving in January is either the ambassador with the 3-day visit or Fitzgerald:
    This is a constraint that states that the person leaving in January is either the ambassador with the 3-day visit or Fitzgerald, but not both. So:
    Xor([January == Day3, January == Fitzgerald]).

-   Quinn will leave 1 month before the ambassador with the 7-day visit:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months of departure for Quinn and the ambassador with the 7-day visit, such that Quinn's month of departure is 1 less than the 7-day visit's month of departure. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == Quinn and m2 == Day7 => m1_to_int == m2_to_int - 1, for all m1, m2 in months of departure.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Bender == 1, and January == 1, and Day2 == 1, then Bender is the diplomat leaving in January with a 2-day visit.

    m1 == Day9 and m2 == Fitzgerald => m1_to_int > m2_to_int, for all m1, m2 in months of departure.

-   Quinn will leave 2 months after Bender:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months of departure for Quinn and Bender, such that Quinn's month of departure is 2 more than Bender's month of departure. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == Quinn and m2 == Bender => m1_to_int == m2_to_int + 2, for all m1, m2 in months of departure.

-   The person leaving in January is either the ambassador with the 3-day visit or Fitzgerald:
    This is a constraint that states that the person leaving in January is either the ambassador with the 3-day visit or Fitzgerald, but not both. So:
    Xor([January == Day3, January == Fitzgerald]).

-   Quinn will leave 1 month before the ambassador with the 7-day visit:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months of departure for Quinn and the ambassador with the 7-day visit, such that Quinn's month of departure is 1 less than the 7-day visit's month of departure. So, the constraints will be of the form:

Clues:
The person who came in at 8:00am asked for wheat bread.
Tricia came in a half-hour after Ora.
Of Felicia and the customer who ordered flatbread, one came in at 7:30am and the other came in at 7:00am.
Of the customer who ordered wheat bread; and the person who ordered pumpernickel, one came in at 8:30am and the other was Tricia.

Entities:
breads: flatbread, pumpernickel, rye bread, wheat bread
times: 7:00am, 7:30am, 8:00am, 8:30am
customers: Felicia, Isabel, Ora, Tricia
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same quartet. For example, if Felicia == 1, and 7:00am == 1, and Flatbread == 1, then Felicia ordered flatbread and came in at 7:00am.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the customers: Felicia, Isabel, Ora, Tricia (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Times of arrival: 7:00am, 7:30am, 8:00am, 8:30am (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Types of bread ordered: Flatbread, Pumpernickel, RyeBread, WheatBread (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The person who came in at 8:00am asked for wheat bread:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    8:00am == WheatBread.

-   Tricia came in a half-hour after Ora:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the times of arrival for Tricia and Ora, such that Tricia's arrival time is half an hour after Ora's arrival time. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    t1 == Tricia and t2 == Ora => t1_to_int == t2_to_int + 0.5, for all t1, t2 in times.

-   Of Felicia and the customer who ordered flatbread, one came in at 7:30am and the other came in at 7:00am:
    This is a constraint that states that for Felicia and the customer who ordered flatbread, one came in at 7:30am and the other came in at 7:00am, but not both. So:
    Xor([
        (Felicia == 7:30am, Flatbread == 7:00am),
        (Felicia == 7:00am, Flatbread == 7:30am)
    ]).

-   Of the customer who ordered wheat bread and the person who ordered pumpernickel, one came in at 8:30am and the other was Tricia:
    This is a constraint that states that for the customer who ordered wheat bread and the person who ordered pumpernickel, one came in at 8:30am and the other was Tricia, but not both. So:

### Constraints:
-   The person who came in at 8:00am asked for wheat bread:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    8:00am == WheatBread.

-   Tricia came in a half-hour after Ora:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the times of arrival for Tricia and Ora, such that Tricia's arrival time is half an hour after Ora's arrival time. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    t1 == Tricia and t2 == Ora => t1_to_int == t2_to_int + 0.5, for all t1, t2 in times.

Clues:
The 75 million year old fossil costs 500 dollars less than the pilodontus.
The senosaurus is 85 million years old.
The 75 million year old fossil costs 500 dollars less than the 78 million year old fossil.
The 75 million year old fossil costs less than the archadon.
The 69 million year old fossil costs 250 dollars more than the 78 million year old fossil.

Entities:
dinosaurs: archadon, mirasaurus, pilodontus, senosaurus
price: $500, $750, $1000, $1250
ages: 69 million, 75 million, 78 million, 85 million
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Archadon == 1, and $500 == 1, and 69million == 1, then the Archadon fossil costs $500 and is 69 million years old.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the dinosaurs: Archadon, Mirasaurus, Pilodontus, Senosaurus (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Prices of the fossils: $500, $750, $1000, $1250 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Ages of the fossils: 69 million, 75 million, 78 million, 85 million (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The 75 million year old fossil costs $500 less than the Pilodontus:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the prices for the 75 million year old fossil and the Pilodontus, such that the 75 million year old fossil's price is $500 less than the Pilodontus's price. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == 75million and p2 == Pilodontus => p1_to_int == p2_to_int - 500, for all p1, p2 in prices.

-   The Senosaurus is 85 million years old:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Senosaurus == 85million.

-   The 75 million year old fossil costs $500 less than the 78 million year old fossil:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the prices for the 75 million year old fossil and the 78 million year old fossil, such that the 75 million year old fossil's price is $500 less than the 78 million year old fossil's price. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == 75million and p2 == 78million => p1_to_int == p2_to_int - 500, for all p1, p2 in prices.

-   The 75 million year old fossil costs less than the Archadon:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the prices for the 75 million year old fossil and the Archadon, such that the 75 million year old fossil's price is less than the Archadon's price. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == 75million and p2 == Archadon => p1_to_int < p2_to_int, for all p1, p2 in prices.

-   The 69 million year old fossil costs $250 more than the 78 million year old fossil:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the prices for the 69 million year old fossil and the 78 million year old fossil, such that the 69 million year old fossil's price is $250 more than the 78 million year old fossil's price. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == 69million and p2 == 78million => p1_to_int == p2_to_int + 250, for all p1, p2 in prices.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Archadon == 1, and $500 == 1, and 69million == 1, then the Archadon fossil costs $500 and is 69 million years old.

### Decision variables:

    p1 == 75million and p2 == Pilodontus => p1_to_int == p2_to_int - 500, for all p1, p2 in prices.

-   The Senosaurus is 85 million years old:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Senosaurus == 85million.

-   The 75 million year old fossil costs $500 less than the 78 million year old fossil:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the prices for the 75 million year old fossil and the 78 million year old fossil, such that the 75 million year old fossil's price is $500 less than the 78 million year old fossil's price. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == 75million and p2 == 78million => p1_to_int == p2_to_int - 500, for all p1, p2 in prices.

times: 8:00am, 9:00am, 10:00am, 11:00am
rooms: dining room, laundry room, living room, mud room
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same quartet. For example, if Glenn == 1, and 8:00am == 1, and DiningRoom == 1, then Glenn's task is in the dining room and starts at 8:00 am.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the children: Glenn, Henrietta, Olivia, Willie (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Start times of the tasks: 8:00am, 9:00am, 10:00am, 11:00am (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Rooms of the tasks: DiningRoom, LaundryRoom, LivingRoom, MudRoom (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   Henrietta's task starts 2 hours after Glenn's job:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the start times for Henrietta and Glenn, such that Henrietta's task starts 2 hours after Glenn's task. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    t1 == Henrietta and t2 == Glenn => t1_to_int == t2_to_int + 2, for all t1, t2 in times.

-   Glenn's task is the dining room:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Glenn == DiningRoom.

-   Glenn's task starts 1 hour after the mud room assignment:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the start times for Glenn and the mud room assignment, such that Glenn's task starts 1 hour after the mud room assignment. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    t1 == Glenn and t2 == MudRoom => t1_to_int == t2_to_int + 1, for all t1, t2 in times.

-   Henrietta's task is the living room:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Henrietta == LivingRoom.

-   The mud room assignment starts sometime before Willie's assignment:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the start times for the mud room assignment and Willie's assignment, such that the mud room assignment starts before Willie's assignment. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    t1 == MudRoom and t2 == Willie => t1_to_int < t2_to_int, for all t1, t2 in times.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same quartet. For example, if Glenn == 1, and 8:00am == 1, and DiningRoom == 1, then Glenn's task is in the dining room and starts at 8:00 am.

    Henrietta == LivingRoom.

-   The mud room assignment starts sometime before Willie's assignment:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the start times for the mud room assignment and Willie's assignment, such that the mud room assignment starts before Willie's assignment. So, the constraints will be of the form:

### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if AlAnderson == 1, and April == 1, and EthelStreet == 1, then Al Anderson's project starts in April on Ethel Street.

Ingram is either the player from the Checkers or the player with 6 goals.

Entities:

-   Parrish scored 1 goal more than Quinn:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the number of goals for Parrish and Quinn, such that Parrish's number of goals is 1 more than Quinn's number of goals. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    g1 == Parrish and g2 == Quinn => g1_to_int == g2_to_int + 1, for all g1, g2 in goals.

-   The player with 9 goals is from the Ice Hogs:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Goals9 == IceHogs.

-   Ingram is either the player from the Checkers or the player with 6 goals:
    This is a constraint that states that Ingram's team is either the Checkers or Ingram's number of goals is 6, but not both. So:
    Xor([Ingram == Checkers, Ingram == Goals6]).
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Ingram == 1, and Goals7 == 1, and Checkers == 1, then Ingram scored 7 goals this season and is from the Checkers.

    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the start months for Natasha's study and the project on the Odyssey, such that Natasha's study's start month is 2 months after the Odyssey's project start month. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == Natasha and m2 == Odyssey => m1_to_int == m2_to_int + 2, for all m1, m2 in months.

-   Of the assignment on the Liberty and the assignment on the Escape, one is Felix's assignment and the other starts in March:
    This is a constraint that states that for the assignments on the Liberty and the Escape, one is Felix's and the other starts in March. So:
    Xor([
        (Liberty == Felix, Escape == March),
        (Liberty == March, Escape == Felix)
    ]).

-   The study on the Liberty starts 2 months after Eunice's project:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the start months for the study on the Liberty and Eunice's project, such that the study on the Liberty's start month is 2 months after Eunice's project start month. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == Liberty and m2 == Eunice => m1_to_int == m2_to_int + 2, for all m1, m2 in months.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Eunice == 1, and March == 1, and Odyssey == 1, then Eunice's project is on the Odyssey and starts in March.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the students: Eunice, Felix, Natasha, Stacy (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Start months of the projects: March, April, May, June (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Names of the ships: Escape, Liberty, Odyssey, Osprey (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   Natasha's study starts 2 months after the project on the Odyssey:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the start months for Natasha's study and the project on the Odyssey, such that Natasha's study's start month is 2 months after the Odyssey's project start month. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == Natasha and m2 == Odyssey => m1_to_int == m2_to_int + 2, for all m1, m2 in months.

-   Of the assignment on the Liberty and the assignment on the Escape, one is Felix's assignment and the other starts in March:
    This is a constraint that states that for the assignments on the Liberty and the Escape, one is Felix's and the other starts in March. So:
    Xor([
        (Liberty == Felix, Escape == March),
        (Liberty == March, Escape == Felix)
    ]).

-   The study on the Liberty starts 2 months after Eunice's project:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the start months for the study on the Liberty and Eunice's project, such that the study on the Liberty's start month is 2 months after Eunice's project start month. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == Liberty and m2 == Eunice => m1_to_int == m2_to_int + 2, for all m1, m2 in months.

    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the years for Dr. Weber's project and the Bale-Hahn SSC, such that Dr. Weber's project's year is 1 less than the Bale-Hahn SSC's year. So, the constraints will be of the form:

    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the years for the Egert Facility and the ISON-X42, such that the Egert Facility's year is 1 more than the ISON-X42's year. So, the constraints will be of the form:

Clues:
The model made by Torvia costs 25 dollars more than the model made by Honwa.
The camera made by Honwa is either the Zenix 2C or the MX-827.
Of the $600 model and the FC-520, one is made by Honwa and the other is made by Dayero.
The Zenix 2C costs less than the FC-520.

Entities:
companies: Banion, Dayero, Honwa, Torvia
prices: $550, $575, $600, $625
cameras: DM-5000, FC-520, MX-827, Zenix 2C
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Banion == 1, and $550 == 1, and DM-5000 == 1, then the model made by Banion costs $550 and is the DM-5000 camera.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the companies: Banion, Dayero, Honwa, Torvia (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Prices of the models: Price550, Price575, Price600, Price625 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Cameras: DM-5000, FC-520, MX-827, Zenix 2C (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The model made by Torvia costs 25 dollars more than the model made by Honwa:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the prices for the model made by Torvia and the model made by Honwa, such that Torvia's model's price is 25 dollars more than Honwa's model's price. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Torvia and p2 == Honwa => p1_to_int == p2_to_int + 25, for all p1, p2 in prices.

-   The camera made by Honwa is either the Zenix 2C or the MX-827:
    This is a constraint that states that the camera made by Honwa is either Zenix 2C or MX-827, but not both. So:
    Xor([Honwa == Zenix2C, Honwa == MX827]).

-   Of the $600 model and the FC-520, one is made by Honwa and the other is made by Dayero:
    This is a constraint that states that for the $600 model and the FC-520, one is associated with Honwa and the other with Dayero, but not both. So:
    Xor([
        (Price600 == Honwa, FC520 == Dayero),
        (Price600 == Dayero, FC520 == Honwa)
    ]).

-   The Zenix 2C costs less than the FC-520:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the prices for the Zenix 2C and the FC-520, such that Zenix 2C's price is less than FC-520's price. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Zenix2C and p2 == FC520 => p1_to_int < p2_to_int, for all p1, p2 in prices.

-   The camera made by Honwa is either the Zenix 2C or the MX-827:
    This is a constraint that states that the camera made by Honwa is either Zenix 2C or MX-827, but not both. So:
    Xor([Honwa == Zenix2C, Honwa == MX827]).

-   Of the $600 model and the FC-520, one is made by Honwa and the other is made by Dayero:
    This is a constraint that states that for the $600 model and the FC-520, one is associated with Honwa and the other with Dayero, but not both. So:

        (Price600 == Honwa, FC520 == Dayero),
        (Price600 == Dayero, FC520 == Honwa)
    ]).

-   The Zenix 2C costs less than the FC-520:

Clues:
The football facility holds more people than Underwood Arena.
The basketball facility holds 80 more people than Vazquez Arena.
Young Arena holds 230 people.
Underwood Arena holds 40 fewer people than Vazquez Arena.
The facility with seating for 190 people is either the lacrosse facility or Underwood Arena.

Entities:
arenas: Gentry, Underwood, Vazquez, Young
capacities: 110, 150, 190, 230
sports: basketball, football, lacrosse, soccer
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Gentry == 1, and 230 == 1, and Football == 1, then Gentry is the football facility with a capacity of 230 people.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the arenas: Gentry, Underwood, Vazquez, Young (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Capacities of the arenas: Capacity110, Capacity150, Capacity190, Capacity230 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Types of sports: Basketball, Football, Lacrosse, Soccer (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The football facility holds more people than Underwood Arena:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the capacities for the football facility and Underwood Arena, such that the football facility's capacity is greater than Underwood Arena's capacity. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    c1 == Football and c2 == Underwood => c1_to_int > c2_to_int, for all c1, c2 in capacities.

-   The basketball facility holds 80 more people than Vazquez Arena:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the capacities for the basketball facility and Vazquez Arena, such that the basketball facility's capacity is 80 more than Vazquez Arena's capacity. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    c1 == Basketball and c2 == Vazquez => c1_to_int == c2_to_int + 80, for all c1, c2 in capacities.

-   Young Arena holds 230 people:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Young == Capacity230.

-   Underwood Arena holds 40 fewer people than Vazquez Arena:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the capacities for Underwood Arena and Vazquez Arena, such that Underwood Arena's capacity is 40 less than Vazquez Arena's capacity. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    c1 == Underwood and c2 == Vazquez => c1_to_int == c2_to_int - 40, for all c1, c2 in capacities.

-   The facility with seating for 190 people is either the lacrosse facility or Underwood Arena:
    This is a constraint that states that the facility with a capacity of 190 people is either the lacrosse facility or Underwood Arena, but not both. So:
    Xor([Capacity190 == Lacrosse, Capacity190 == Underwood]).
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Gentry == 1, and 230 == 1, and Football == 1, then Gentry is the football facility with a capacity of 230 people.

### Constraints:
-   The football facility holds more people than Underwood Arena:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the capacities for the football facility and Underwood Arena, such that the football facility's capacity is greater than Underwood Arena's capacity. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    c1 == Football and c2 == Underwood => c1_to_int > c2_to_int, for all c1, c2 in capacities.

-   The basketball facility holds 80 more people than Vazquez Arena:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the capacities for the basketball facility and Vazquez Arena, such that the basketball facility's capacity is 80 more than Vazquez Arena's capacity. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    c1 == Basketball and c2 == Vazquez => c1_to_int == c2_to_int + 80, for all c1, c2 in capacities.

-   Young Arena holds 230 people:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Young == Capacity230.

-   Underwood Arena holds 40 fewer people than Vazquez Arena:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the capacities for Underwood Arena and Vazquez Arena, such that Underwood Arena's capacity is 40 less than Vazquez Arena's capacity. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    c1 == Underwood and c2 == Vazquez => c1_to_int == c2_to_int - 40, for all c1, c2 in capacities.

-   The facility with seating for 190 people is either the lacrosse facility or Underwood Arena:
    This is a constraint that states that the facility with a capacity of 190 people is either the lacrosse facility or Underwood Arena, but not both. So:

Clues:
Hope paid less than Delia.
Patricia had the cappuccino.
The one who had the cafe americano paid 1 dollar more than Patricia.
Hope paid more than the one who had the cafe americano.
The one who had the chai tea paid 1 dollar more than the one who had the cafe americano.

Entities:
names: Delia, Hope, Patricia, Wayne
prices: $5, $6, $7, $8
drinks: cafe americano, cafe latte, cappuccino, chai tea
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Hope == 1, and $6 == 1, and CafeLatte == 1, then Hope paid $6 for a cafe latte.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the customers: Delia, Hope, Patricia, Wayne (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Prices paid by the customers: Price5, Price6, Price7, Price8 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Types of the drinks: CafeAmericano, CafeLatte, Cappuccino, ChaiTea (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   Hope paid less than Delia:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the prices for Hope and Delia, such that Hope's price is less than Delia's price. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Hope and p2 == Delia => p1_to_int < p2_to_int, for all p1, p2 in prices.

-   Patricia had the cappuccino:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Patricia == Cappuccino.

-   The one who had the cafe americano paid 1 dollar more than Patricia:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the prices for the one who had the cafe americano and Patricia, such that the cafe americano's price is 1 dollar more than Patricia's price. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == CafeAmericano and p2 == Patricia => p1_to_int == p2_to_int + 1, for all p1, p2 in prices.

-   Hope paid more than the one who had the cafe americano:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the prices for Hope and the one who had the cafe americano, such that Hope's price is more than the cafe americano's price. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Hope and p2 == CafeAmericano => p1_to_int > p2_to_int, for all p1, p2 in prices.

-   The one who had the chai tea paid 1 dollar more than the one who had the cafe americano:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the prices for the one who had the chai tea and the one who had the cafe americano, such that the chai tea's price is 1 dollar more than the cafe americano's price. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == ChaiTea and p2 == CafeAmericano => p1_to_int == p2_to_int + 1, for all p1, p2 in prices.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Hope == 1, and $6 == 1, and CafeLatte == 1, then Hope paid $6 for a cafe latte.

-   Patricia had the cappuccino:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Patricia == Cappuccino.

-   The one who had the cafe americano paid 1 dollar more than Patricia:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the prices for the one who had the cafe americano and Patricia, such that the cafe americano's price is 1 dollar more than Patricia's price. So, the constraints will be of the form:

names: Merlin, Pepper, Spike, Sunshine
ages: 4, 5, 8, 9
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Merlin == 1, and 102inches == 1, and Age4 == 1, then Merlin is the condor with a wingspan of 102 inches and is 4 years old.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the condors: Merlin, Pepper, Spike, Sunshine (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Wingspans of the condors: Wingspan102, Wingspan106, Wingspan110, Wingspan114 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Ages of the condors: Age4, Age5, Age8, Age9 (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   Sunshine is either the condor with a wingspan of 102 inches or the 5-year-old bird:
    This is a constraint that states that Sunshine's wingspan is either 102 inches or Sunshine is the 5-year-old bird, but not both. So:
    Xor([Sunshine == Wingspan102, Sunshine == Age5]).

-   The condor with a wingspan of 114 inches is 5 years old:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Wingspan114 == Age5.

-   Pepper has a wingspan of 114 inches:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Pepper == Wingspan114.

-   The four condors are the 9-year-old bird, Pepper, Merlin, and the condor with a wingspan of 106 inches:
    This is a constraint that states that all these entities are different, thus:
    AllDifferent([Age9, Pepper, Merlin, Wingspan106]).

-   The 9-year-old bird has a wingspan 4 inches shorter than the 4-year-old bird:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the wingspans for the 9-year-old bird and the 4-year-old bird, such that the 9-year-old bird's wingspan is 4 inches shorter than the 4-year-old bird's wingspan. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    w1 == Age9 and w2 == Age4 => w1_to_int == w2_to_int - 4, for all w1, w2 in wingspans.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Merlin == 1, and 102inches == 1, and Age4 == 1, then Merlin is the condor with a wingspan of 102 inches and is 4 years old.

    Xor([Sunshine == Wingspan102, Sunshine == Age5]).

-   The condor with a wingspan of 114 inches is 5 years old:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Wingspan114 == Age5.

-   Pepper has a wingspan of 114 inches:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Pepper == Wingspan114.

-   The four condors are the 9-year-old bird, Pepper, Merlin, and the condor with a wingspan of 106 inches:
    This is a constraint that states that all these entities are different, thus:
    AllDifferent([Age9, Pepper, Merlin, Wingspan106]).

-   The 9-year-old bird has a wingspan 4 inches shorter than the 4-year-old bird:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the wingspans for the 9-year-old bird and the 4-year-old bird, such that the 9-year-old bird's wingspan is 4 inches shorter than the 4-year-old bird's wingspan. So, the constraints will be of the form:

Clues:
The worker who works in the green section served more riders than Brett.
Peter served 25 fewer riders than Willis.
Brett served more riders than Peter.
The person who works in the yellow section served 25 more riders than the worker who works in the orange section.
Peter is either the person who served 125 riders or the person who works in the blue section.

Entities:
employees: Brett, Peter, Victor, Willis
rides: 50 riders, 75 riders, 100 riders, 125 riders
section: blue, green, orange, yellow
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Brett == 1, and 50riders == 1, and Green == 1, then Brett is the worker who served 50 riders and works in the green section.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the employees: Brett, Peter, Victor, Willis (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Number of riders served: Riders50, Riders75, Riders100, Riders125 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Colors of the sections: Blue, Green, Orange, Yellow (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The worker who works in the green section served more riders than Brett:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the number of riders served by the worker in the green section and Brett, such that the green section's worker served more riders than Brett. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    r1 == Green and r2 == Brett => r1_to_int > r2_to_int, for all r1, r2 in rides.

-   Peter served 25 fewer riders than Willis:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the number of riders served by Peter and Willis, such that Peter served 25 fewer riders than Willis. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    r1 == Peter and r2 == Willis => r1_to_int == r2_to_int - 25, for all r1, r2 in rides.

-   Brett served more riders than Peter:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the number of riders served by Brett and Peter, such that Brett served more riders than Peter. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    r1 == Brett and r2 == Peter => r1_to_int > r2_to_int, for all r1, r2 in rides.

    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the number of riders served by the worker in the yellow section and the worker in the orange section, such that the yellow section's worker served 25 more riders than the orange section's worker. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    r1 == Yellow and r2 == Orange => r1_to_int == r2_to_int + 25, for all r1, r2 in rides.

-   Peter is either the person who served 125 riders or the person who works in the blue section:
    This is a constraint that states that Peter's number of riders served is either 125 or Peter works in the blue section, but not both. So:
    Xor([Peter == Riders125, Peter == Blue]).
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Brett == 1, and 50riders == 1, and Green == 1, then Brett is the worker who served 50 riders and works in the green section.

-   Brett served more riders than Peter:

    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the number of gold medals for Dominica and the squad that won 5 silver medals, such that Dominica's gold medals are 1 less than the squad's gold medals that won 5 silver medals. So, the constraints will be of the form:

    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Vorckin == Diameter125.

-   The 150 meters wide one is either the Ordovician impact crater or the Permian impact crater:
    This is a constraint that states that the crater with a diameter of 150 meters is either associated with the Ordovician period or the Permian period, but not both. So:
    Xor([Diameter150 == Ordovician, Diameter150 == Permian]).

-   The Ordovician impact crater is 25 meters wider than the Jurassic impact crater:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the diameters for the Ordovician and Jurassic craters, such that the Ordovician crater's diameter is 25 meters wider than the Jurassic crater's diameter. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    d1 == Ordovician and d2 == Jurassic => d1_to_int == d2_to_int + 25, for all d1, d2 in diameters.

-   The Triassic impact crater is either the Ormagh impact crater or the 150 meters wide one:
    This is a constraint that states that the Triassic crater is either Ormagh or has a diameter of 150 meters, but not both. So:
    Xor([Triassic == Ormagh, Triassic == Diameter150]).

-   The Cersay impact crater was formed during the Jurassic period:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Cersay == Jurassic.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Cersay == 1, and 100meters == 1, and Jurassic == 1, then Cersay is the crater with a diameter of 100 meters and was formed during the Jurassic period.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the craters: Cersay, Moriwa, Ormagh, Vorckin (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Diameters of the craters: Diameter100, Diameter125, Diameter150, Diameter175 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Geological periods of the craters: Jurassic, Ordovician, Permian, Triassic (all different, 1 to 4)

    d1 == Ordovician and d2 == Jurassic => d1_to_int == d2_to_int + 25, for all d1, d2 in diameters.

-   The Triassic impact crater is either the Ormagh impact crater or the 150 meters wide one:
    This is a constraint that states that the Triassic crater is either Ormagh or has a diameter of 150 meters, but not both. So:
    Xor([Triassic == Ormagh, Triassic == Diameter150]).

    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Cersay == Jurassic.

Clues:
The butterfly that was auctioned 7th sold for 20 dollars less than the insect won by Daniel.
The four butterflies were the insect that sold for $260, the butterfly that was auctioned 4th, the butterfly that was auctioned 7th and the butterfly won by Roland.
The butterfly won by Gabriel was the 8th lot.

Entities:
winners: Daniel, Gabriel, Roland, Vincent
prices: $250, $260, $270, $280

    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the prices for the butterfly auctioned 7th and the butterfly won by Daniel, such that the butterfly auctioned 7th's price is 20 dollars less than Daniel's butterfly's price. So, the constraints will be of the form:

-   The four butterflies were the insect that sold for $260, the butterfly that was auctioned 4th, the butterfly that was auctioned 7th, and the butterfly won by Roland:
    This is a constraint that states that all these entities are different, thus:

Clues:
Hattie and the student who will major in Theology are different students.
The student who will major in English is either Tracy or the student who received the $25,000 scholarship.
Hattie was awarded $10,000 more than the person who will major in Physics.
The student who received the $40,000 scholarship will major in Theology.
Ora was awarded some amount less than the student who will major in Archaeology.

Entities:
names: Erma, Hattie, Ora, Tracy
scholarships: $25,000, $30,000, $35,000, $40,000
majors: Archaeology, English, Physics, Theology
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same quartet. For example, if Erma == 1, and $25,000 == 1, and Archaeology == 1, then Erma received the $25,000 scholarship and will major in Archaeology.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the students: Erma, Hattie, Ora, Tracy (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Scholarship amounts: $25,000, $30,000, $35,000, $40,000 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Majors: Archaeology, English, Physics, Theology (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   Hattie and the student who will major in Theology are different students:
    This is a constraint that states that Hattie and the student majoring in Theology are different, thus:
    AllDifferent([Hattie, Theology]).

-   The student who will major in English is either Tracy or the student who received the $25,000 scholarship:
    This is a constraint that states that the student majoring in English is either Tracy or the student with the $25,000 scholarship, but not both. So:
    Xor([English == Tracy, English == $25,000]).

-   Hattie was awarded $10,000 more than the person who will major in Physics:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of scholarship amounts to Hattie and the student majoring in Physics, such that Hattie's scholarship amount is $10,000 more than the student majoring in Physics. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    s1 == Hattie and s2 == Physics => s1_to_int == s2_to_int + 10, for all s1, s2 in scholarships.

-   The student who received the $40,000 scholarship will major in Theology:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    $40,000 == Theology.

-   Ora was awarded some amount less than the student who will major in Archaeology:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of scholarship amounts to Ora and the student majoring in Archaeology, such that Ora's scholarship amount is less than the student majoring in Archaeology. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    s1 == Ora and s2 == Archaeology => s1_to_int < s2_to_int, for all s1, s2 in scholarships.
### Plan:

-   The student who received the $40,000 scholarship will major in Theology:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    $40,000 == Theology.

-   Ora was awarded some amount less than the student who will major in Archaeology:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of scholarship amounts to Ora and the student majoring in Archaeology, such that Ora's scholarship amount is less than the student majoring in Archaeology. So, the constraints will be of the form:

Clues:
Hatcha started 6 years after the wing back.
Kawa began playing in 1982.
Banben was the center back.
The person who started in 1985 was either Kawa or the center forward.

Entities:
players: Banben, Hatcha, Kawa, Rothvum
years: 1976, 1979, 1982, 1985
positions: center back, center forward, goalie, wing back
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Banben == 1, and 1976 == 1, and CenterBack == 1, then Banben started in 1976 as a center back.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the players: Banben, Hatcha, Kawa, Rothvum (all different, 1 to 4)

-   Positions of the players: CenterBack, CenterForward, Goalie, WingBack (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   Hatcha started 6 years after the wing back:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the start years for Hatcha and the wing back, such that Hatcha's start year is 6 years after the wing back's start year. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    y1 == Hatcha and y2 == WingBack => y1_to_int == y2_to_int + 6, for all y1, y2 in years.

-   Kawa began playing in 1982:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Kawa == Year1982.

-   Banben was the center back:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Banben == CenterBack.

-   The person who started in 1985 was either Kawa or the center forward:
    This is a constraint that states that the player who started in 1985's position is either Kawa or the center forward, but not both. So:
    Xor([Year1985 == Kawa, Year1985 == CenterForward]).
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Banben == 1, and 1976 == 1, and CenterBack == 1, then Banben started in 1976 as a center back.

Clues:
The puzzle with the postage stamp theme has somewhat fewer than the puzzle made by Astury.
The jigsaw puzzle with the outer space theme has 250 more pieces than the puzzle made by Garroda.
The jigsaw puzzle made by Garroda has somewhat fewer than the puzzle made by Vesem.
The jigsaw puzzle with the postage stamp theme has somewhat more than the puzzle with the city skyline theme.
The jigsaw puzzle made by Vesem has 500 pieces.

Entities:
companies: Astury, Denlend, Garroda, Vesem
pieces: 250, 500, 750, 1000
themes: autumn leaves, city skyline, outer space, postage stamp
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same quartet. For example, if Astury == 1, and 1000 == 1, and PostageStamp == 1, then the puzzle made by Astury has 1000 pieces and the postage stamp theme.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the companies: Astury, Denlend, Garroda, Vesem (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Number of pieces in the puzzles: Pieces250, Pieces500, Pieces750, Pieces1000 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Themes of the puzzles: AutumnLeaves, CitySkyline, OuterSpace, PostageStamp (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The puzzle with the postage stamp theme has somewhat fewer pieces than the puzzle made by Astury:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the number of pieces for the postage stamp theme and Astury, such that the postage stamp theme's puzzle has fewer pieces than Astury's puzzle. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == PostageStamp and p2 == Astury => p1_to_int < p2_to_int, for all p1, p2 in pieces.

-   The jigsaw puzzle with the outer space theme has 250 more pieces than the puzzle made by Garroda:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the number of pieces for the outer space theme and Garroda, such that the outer space theme's puzzle has 250 more pieces than Garroda's puzzle. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == OuterSpace and p2 == Garroda => p1_to_int == p2_to_int + 250, for all p1, p2 in pieces.

-   The jigsaw puzzle made by Garroda has somewhat fewer pieces than the puzzle made by Vesem:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the number of pieces for Garroda and Vesem, such that Garroda's puzzle has fewer pieces than Vesem's puzzle. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Garroda and p2 == Vesem => p1_to_int < p2_to_int, for all p1, p2 in pieces.

-   The jigsaw puzzle with the postage stamp theme has somewhat more pieces than the puzzle with the city skyline theme:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the number of pieces for the postage stamp theme and the city skyline theme, such that the postage stamp theme's puzzle has more pieces than the city skyline theme's puzzle. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == PostageStamp and p2 == CitySkyline => p1_to_int > p2_to_int, for all p1, p2 in pieces.

-   The jigsaw puzzle made by Vesem has 500 pieces:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Vesem == Pieces500.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same quartet. For example, if Astury == 1, and 1000 == 1, and PostageStamp == 1, then the puzzle made by Astury has 1000 pieces and the postage stamp theme.

-   The jigsaw puzzle with the outer space theme has 250 more pieces than the puzzle made by Garroda:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the number of pieces for the outer space theme and Garroda, such that the outer space theme's puzzle has 250 more pieces than Garroda's puzzle. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == OuterSpace and p2 == Garroda => p1_to_int == p2_to_int + 250, for all p1, p2 in pieces.

-   The jigsaw puzzle made by Garroda has somewhat fewer pieces than the puzzle made by Vesem:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the number of pieces for Garroda and Vesem, such that Garroda's puzzle has fewer pieces than Vesem's puzzle. So, the constraints will be of the form:

The photo of the giant tortoise was taken in June.

Entities:
animals: giant tortoise, orangutan, polar bear, white rhino
months: March, April, May, June
magazines: Animal Science, Earth Aware, Nature Monthly, Wildzone
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same quartet. For example, if GiantTortoise == 1, and June == 1, and AnimalScience == 1, then the photo of the giant tortoise was taken in June and published by Animal Science.

### Decision variables:

-   Magazines: AnimalScience, EarthAware, NatureMonthly, Wildzone (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The photo published by Nature Monthly was taken 2 months after the photo published by Earth Aware:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months for the photos published by Nature Monthly and Earth Aware, such that the Nature Monthly's photo was taken 2 months after Earth Aware's photo. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == NatureMonthly and m2 == EarthAware => m1_to_int == m2_to_int + 2, for all m1, m2 in months.

-   The shot of the white rhino was either the photo published by Earth Aware or the photo published by Animal Science:
    This is a constraint that states that the white rhino's photo was published by either Earth Aware or Animal Science, but not both. So:
    Xor([WhiteRhino == EarthAware, WhiteRhino == AnimalScience]).

-   The photo of the polar bear was taken sometime before the shot of the white rhino:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months for the photos of the polar bear and the white rhino, such that the polar bear's photo was taken before the white rhino's photo. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == PolarBear and m2 == WhiteRhino => m1_to_int < m2_to_int, for all m1, m2 in months.

-   The photo taken in April was published by Animal Science:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:

Clues:
Oginao is either the 105 ft tall fall or the 115 ft tall waterfall.
Oginao is 5 ft shorter than Irskela.
The fall in Brazil is either Cerbel or Inawatai.
Inawatai is in New Zealand.
Cerbel is 10 ft shorter than the fall in Canada.

Entities:
names: Cerbel, Irskela, Inawatai, Oginao
heights: 100 ft, 105 ft, 110 ft, 115 ft
countries: Canada, Brazil, New Zealand, Switzerland
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Cerbel == 1, and 100ft == 1, and Canada == 1, then Cerbel is the 100 ft tall fall located in Canada.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the waterfalls: Cerbel, Irskela, Inawatai, Oginao (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Heights of the waterfalls: Height100, Height105, Height110, Height115 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Countries of the waterfalls: Canada, Brazil, New Zealand, Switzerland (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   Oginao is either the 105 ft tall fall or the 115 ft tall waterfall:
    This is a constraint that states that Oginao's height is either 105 ft or 115 ft. So:
    Xor([Oginao == Height105, Oginao == Height115]).

-   Oginao is 5 ft shorter than Irskela:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the heights for Oginao and Irskela, such that Oginao's height is 5 ft shorter than Irskela's height. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    h1 == Oginao and h2 == Irskela => h1_to_int == h2_to_int - 5, for all h1, h2 in heights.

-   The fall in Brazil is either Cerbel or Inawatai:
    This is a constraint that states that the fall in Brazil is either Cerbel or Inawatai. So:
    Or([Cerbel == Brazil, Inawatai == Brazil]).

-   Inawatai is in New Zealand:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Inawatai == NewZealand.

-   Cerbel is 10 ft shorter than the fall in Canada:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the heights for Cerbel and the fall in Canada, such that Cerbel's height is 10 ft shorter than the fall in Canada's height. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    h1 == Cerbel and h2 == Canada => h1_to_int == h2_to_int - 10, for all h1, h2 in heights.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Cerbel == 1, and 100ft == 1, and Canada == 1, then Cerbel is the 100 ft tall fall located in Canada.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the waterfalls: Cerbel, Irskela, Inawatai, Oginao (all different, 1 to 4)

-   Countries of the waterfalls: Canada, Brazil, New Zealand, Switzerland (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   Oginao is either the 105 ft tall fall or the 115 ft tall waterfall:
    This is a constraint that states that Oginao's height is either 105 ft or 115 ft. So:
    Xor([Oginao == Height105, Oginao == Height115]).

-   Oginao is 5 ft shorter than Irskela:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the heights for Oginao and Irskela, such that Oginao's height is 5 ft shorter than Irskela's height. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    h1 == Oginao and h2 == Irskela => h1_to_int == h2_to_int - 5, for all h1, h2 in heights.

-   The fall in Brazil is either Cerbel or Inawatai:
    This is a constraint that states that the fall in Brazil is either Cerbel or Inawatai. So:
    Or([Cerbel == Brazil, Inawatai == Brazil]).

-   Inawatai is in New Zealand:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Inawatai == NewZealand.

-   Cerbel is 10 ft shorter than the fall in Canada:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the heights for Cerbel and the fall in Canada, such that Cerbel's height is 10 ft shorter than the fall in Canada's height. So, the constraints will be of the form:

prices: $500, $750, $1000, $1250
ages: 72 million, 75 million, 78 million, 90 million
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Gigasaurus == 1, and $500 == 1, and 72 million == 1, then Gigasaurus costs $500 and is 72 million years old.

### Decision variables:

### Constraints:
-   The 90 million year old fossil costs 250 dollars more than the pilodontus:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the prices for the 90 million year old fossil and the pilodontus, such that the 90 million year old fossil's price is 250 dollars more than the pilodontus's price. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == 90 million and p2 == Pilodontus => p1_to_int == p2_to_int + 250, for all p1, p2 in prices.

-   The gigasaurus costs 500 dollars more than the 78 million year old fossil:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the prices for the gigasaurus and the 78 million year old fossil, such that the gigasaurus's price is 500 dollars more than the 78 million year old fossil's price. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Gigasaurus and p2 == 78 million => p1_to_int == p2_to_int + 500, for all p1, p2 in prices.

-   The gigasaurus costs 250 dollars less than the 75 million year old fossil:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the prices for the gigasaurus and the 75 million year old fossil, such that the gigasaurus's price is 250 dollars less than the 75 million year old fossil's price. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Gigasaurus and p2 == 75 million => p1_to_int == p2_to_int - 250, for all p1, p2 in prices.

-   The mirasaurus is 90 million years old:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Mirasaurus == 90 million.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Gigasaurus == 1, and $500 == 1, and 72 million == 1, then Gigasaurus costs $500 and is 72 million years old.

### Constraints:
-   The 90 million year old fossil costs 250 dollars more than the pilodontus:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the prices for the 90 million year old fossil and the pilodontus, such that the 90 million year old fossil's price is 250 dollars more than the pilodontus's price. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == 90 million and p2 == Pilodontus => p1_to_int == p2_to_int + 250, for all p1, p2 in prices.

-   The gigasaurus costs 500 dollars more than the 78 million year old fossil:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the prices for the gigasaurus and the 78 million year old fossil, such that the gigasaurus's price is 500 dollars more than the 78 million year old fossil's price. So, the constraints will be of the form:

Clues:
The four conductors are Roderick, the conductor working on June 10, the person departing from Leland and the person departing from Indio.
The person working on June 13 will depart from Hardwick.
The conductor working on June 12 is either the conductor departing from Indio or Roderick.
Vernon is either the person working on June 11 or the conductor working on June 13.
Francis will leave sometime before the conductor departing from Leland.

Entities:
names: Francis, Luke, Roderick, Vernon
days: June 10, June 11, June 12, June 13
departures: Hardwick, Indio, Kent, Leland
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same quartet. For example, if Francis == 1, and June10 == 1, and Hardwick == 1, then Francis will depart from Hardwick on June 10.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the conductors: Francis, Luke, Roderick, Vernon (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Days of work: June10, June11, June12, June13 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Departure locations: Hardwick, Indio, Kent, Leland (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The four conductors are Roderick, the conductor working on June 10, the person departing from Leland, and the person departing from Indio:
    This is a constraint that states the specific pairing of conductors, workdays, and departure locations. So, we can directly assign these entities to their respective values.

-   The person working on June 13 will depart from Hardwick:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    June13 == Hardwick.

-   The conductor working on June 12 is either the conductor departing from Indio or Roderick:
    This is a constraint that states that the conductor working on June 12 is either the one departing from Indio or Roderick, but not both. So:
    Xor([June12 == Indio, June12 == Roderick]).

-   Vernon is either the person working on June 11 or the conductor working on June 13:
    This is a constraint that states that Vernon is either working on June 11 or working on June 13, but not both. So:
    Xor([Vernon == June11, Vernon == June13]).

-   Francis will leave sometime before the conductor departing from Leland:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the departure locations for Francis and the conductor departing from Leland, such that Francis's departure is before the conductor departing from Leland. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    d1 == Francis and d2 == Leland => d1_to_int < d2_to_int, for all d1, d2 in departures.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same quartet. For example, if Francis == 1, and June10 == 1, and Hardwick == 1, then Francis will depart from Hardwick on June 10.

### Decision variables:

    This is a constraint that states that the conductor working on June 12 is either the one departing from Indio or Roderick, but not both. So:
    Xor([June12 == Indio, June12 == Roderick]).

-   Vernon is either the person working on June 11 or the conductor working on June 13:
    This is a constraint that states that Vernon is either working on June 11 or working on June 13, but not both. So:
    Xor([Vernon == June11, Vernon == June13]).

-   Francis will leave sometime before the conductor departing from Leland:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the departure locations for Francis and the conductor departing from Leland, such that Francis's departure is before the conductor departing from Leland. So, the constraints will be of the form:

Ann Alexander's rental is for 4 days.

Entities:
customers: Ann Alexander, Edna Erickson, Irene Ingram, Kathy Koch
contract length: 2 days, 3 days, 4 days, 5 days
cars: Fiat, Kia, Nissan, Toyota
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if AnnAlexander == 1, and FourDays == 1, and Fiat == 1, then Ann Alexander's rental is for 4 days and is a Fiat.

### Decision variables:

-   Contract lengths: TwoDays, ThreeDays, FourDays, FiveDays (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Cars: Fiat, Kia, Nissan, Toyota (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The Kia rental is for a period 1 day shorter than the Toyota rental:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the contract lengths for the Kia rental and the Toyota rental, such that the Kia rental's length is 1 day shorter than the Toyota rental's length. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    c1 == Kia and c2 == Toyota => c1_to_int == c2_to_int - 1, for all c1, c2 in contract lengths.

-   The 4 day rental is for the Fiat:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    FourDays == Fiat.

-   Kathy Koch's reservation is either the 5 day reservation or the Fiat rental:
    This is a constraint that states that Kathy Koch's reservation is either for 5 days or is a Fiat rental, but not both. So:
    Xor([KathyKoch == FiveDays, KathyKoch == Fiat]).

-   The 3 day rental, Irene Ingram's reservation, and Kathy Koch's reservation are all different rentals:
    This is a constraint that states that the 3 day rental, Irene Ingram's reservation, and Kathy Koch's reservation are all different. So:
    AllDifferent([ThreeDays, IreneIngram, KathyKoch]).

-   Ann Alexander's rental is for 4 days:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    AnnAlexander == FourDays.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if AnnAlexander == 1, and FourDays == 1, and Fiat == 1, then Ann Alexander's rental is for 4 days and is a Fiat.

    c1 == Kia and c2 == Toyota => c1_to_int == c2_to_int - 1, for all c1, c2 in contract lengths.

-   The 4 day rental is for the Fiat:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    FourDays == Fiat.

-   Kathy Koch's reservation is either the 5 day reservation or the Fiat rental:
    This is a constraint that states that Kathy Koch's reservation is either for 5 days or is a Fiat rental, but not both. So:
    Xor([KathyKoch == FiveDays, KathyKoch == Fiat]).

-   The 3 day rental, Irene Ingram's reservation, and Kathy Koch's reservation are all different rentals:
    This is a constraint that states that the 3 day rental, Irene Ingram's reservation, and Kathy Koch's reservation are all different. So:
    AllDifferent([ThreeDays, IreneIngram, KathyKoch]).

-   Ann Alexander's rental is for 4 days:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    AnnAlexander == FourDays.

Clues:
The person with 72 LinkedIn connections has 10 fewer Facebook friends than the person with 84 LinkedIn connections.
Yvonne has 20 fewer Facebook friends than Margie.
The four people are the one with 68 LinkedIn connections, Jonathan, Rosie and the person with 120 Facebook friends.
Rosie has 150 Facebook friends.

Entities:
Facebook: 120, 130, 140, 150
LinkedIn: 57, 68, 72, 84
names: Jonathan, Margie, Rosie, Yvonne
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Jonathan == 1, and LinkedIn68 == 1, and Facebook120 == 1, then Jonathan has 68 LinkedIn connections and 120 Facebook friends.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the people: Jonathan, Margie, Rosie, Yvonne (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Number of LinkedIn connections: LinkedIn57, LinkedIn68, LinkedIn72, LinkedIn84 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Number of Facebook friends: Facebook120, Facebook130, Facebook140, Facebook150 (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The person with 72 LinkedIn connections has 10 fewer Facebook friends than the person with 84 LinkedIn connections:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the number of LinkedIn connections for the person with 72 connections and the person with 84 connections, such that the person with 72 connections has 10 fewer Facebook friends than the person with 84 connections. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    l1 == LinkedIn72 and l2 == LinkedIn84 => f1_to_int == f2_to_int - 10, for all l1, l2 in LinkedIn.

-   Yvonne has 20 fewer Facebook friends than Margie:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the number of Facebook friends for Yvonne and Margie, such that Yvonne has 20 fewer Facebook friends than Margie. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    f1 == Yvonne and f2 == Margie => f1_to_int == f2_to_int - 20, for all f1, f2 in Facebook.

-   The four people are the one with 68 LinkedIn connections, Jonathan, Rosie, and the person with 120 Facebook friends:
    This is a constraint that states that all these entities are different, thus:
    AllDifferent([LinkedIn68, Jonathan, Rosie, Facebook120]).

-   Rosie has 150 Facebook friends:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Rosie == Facebook150.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing.

    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the wingspans for the 11-year-old bird and Charlie, such that the 11-year-old bird's wingspan is 8 inches shorter than Charlie's wingspan. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    w1 == Age11 and w2 == Charlie => w1_to_int == w2_to_int - 8, for all w1, w2 in wingspans.

-   Angel is either the 8-year-old bird or the bird with a wingspan of 114 inches:
    This is a constraint that states that Angel's age is either 8 years old or Angel has a wingspan of 114 inches, but not both. So:
    Xor([Angel == Age8, Angel == Wingspan114]).
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Angel == 1, and 102inches == 1, and Age8 == 1, then Angel is the bird with a wingspan of 102 inches and is 8 years old.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the birds: Angel, Charlie, Gracie, Merlin (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Wingspans of the birds: Wingspan102, Wingspan106, Wingspan110, Wingspan114 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Ages of the birds: Age8, Age9, Age10, Age11 (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   Charlie is 9 years old:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Charlie == Age9.

-   Gracie has a wingspan of 114 inches:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Gracie == Wingspan114.

-   The 11-year-old bird has a wingspan 8 inches shorter than Charlie:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the wingspans for the 11-year-old bird and Charlie, such that the 11-year-old bird's wingspan is 8 inches shorter than Charlie's wingspan. So, the constraints will be of the form:

    This is a constraint that states that Angel's age is either 8 years old or Angel has a wingspan of 114 inches, but not both. So:

Clues:
The TrustCo card has an APR of 11%.
The Southwest Inc card has a limit of $2,000.
The card with an APR of 11% is either the card with the $4,000 credit limit or the one with the $20,000 credit limit.
The card with an APR of 10% is either the card with the $4,000 credit limit or the TrustCo card.
The Credit Korp card has an APR 1 percent lower than the one with the $2,000 credit limit.

Entities:
credit cards: Credit Korp, Mid Atlantic, Southwest Inc, TrustCo
APR: 8%, 9%, 10%, 11%
credit limits: $2,000, $4,000, $5,000, $20,000
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if CreditKorp == 1, and 8% == 1, and $2,000 == 1, then the Credit Korp card has an APR of 8% and a credit limit of $2,000.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the credit cards: CreditKorp, MidAtlantic, SouthwestInc, TrustCo (all different, 1 to 4)
-   APRs of the credit cards: APR8, APR9, APR10, APR11 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Credit limits of the credit cards: $2,000, $4,000, $5,000, $20,000 (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The TrustCo card has an APR of 11%:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    TrustCo == APR11.

-   The Southwest Inc card has a limit of $2,000:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    SouthwestInc == $2,000.

-   The card with an APR of 11% is either the card with the $4,000 credit limit or the one with the $20,000 credit limit:
    This is a constraint that states that the card with an APR of 11% has either a $4,000 credit limit or a $20,000 credit limit, but not both. So:
    Xor([APR11 == $4,000, APR11 == $20,000]).

-   The card with an APR of 10% is either the card with the $4,000 credit limit or the TrustCo card:
    This is a constraint that states that the card with an APR of 10% has either a $4,000 credit limit or is the TrustCo card, but not both. So:
    Xor([APR10 == $4,000, APR10 == TrustCo]).

-   The Credit Korp card has an APR 1 percent lower than the one with the $2,000 credit limit:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the APRs for Credit Korp and the card with the $2,000 credit limit, such that Credit Korp's APR is 1 percent lower than the card with the $2,000 credit limit's APR. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    a1 == CreditKorp and a2 == $2,000 => a1_to_int == a2_to_int - 1, for all a1, a2 in APRs.
### Plan:

### Constraints:
-   The TrustCo card has an APR of 11%:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    TrustCo == APR11.

-   The Southwest Inc card has a limit of $2,000:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    SouthwestInc == $2,000.

-   The card with an APR of 11% is either the card with the $4,000 credit limit or the one with the $20,000 credit limit:
    This is a constraint that states that the card with an APR of 11% has either a $4,000 credit limit or a $20,000 credit limit, but not both. So:
    Xor([APR11 == $4,000, APR11 == $20,000]).

-   The card with an APR of 10% is either the card with the $4,000 credit limit or the TrustCo card:
    This is a constraint that states that the card with an APR of 10% has either a $4,000 credit limit or is the TrustCo card, but not both. So:
    Xor([APR10 == $4,000, APR10 == TrustCo]).

-   The Credit Korp card has an APR 1 percent lower than the one with the $2,000 credit limit:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the APRs for Credit Korp and the card with the $2,000 credit limit, such that Credit Korp's APR is 1 percent lower than the card with the $2,000 credit limit's APR. So, the constraints will be of the form:

-   Ebony's book was due 1 week after Rosa's book:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the due dates for Ebony's book and Rosa's book, such that Ebony's book's due date is 1 week (or one step in the given due dates) after Rosa's book's due date. So, the constraints will be of the form:

-   Aimee's book was due on September 15:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:

The siren released in 1997 is either the Soundarm or the Viking 5.
The Armor-Stop is louder than the siren released in 2009.

decibels: 100 decibels, 105 decibels, 110 decibels, 115 decibels
years: 1996, 1997, 2000, 2009
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if ArmorStop == 1, and 100decibels == 1, and 1996 == 1, then the Armor-Stop siren released in 1996 is 100 decibels loud.

### Decision variables:

### Constraints:

-   The siren released in 2009 is either the Armor-Stop or the Viking 5:
    This is a constraint that states that the siren released in 2009 is either the Armor-Stop or the Viking 5, but not both. So:

-   The Armor-Stop is louder than the siren released in 2009:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the decibel levels for the Armor-Stop and the siren released in 2009, such that the Armor-Stop is louder than the siren released in 2009. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    d1 == ArmorStop and d2 == Year2009 => d1_to_int > d2_to_int, for all d1, d2 in decibels.

-   The Soundarm is 110 decibels loud:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Soundarm == Decibels110.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if ArmorStop == 1, and 100decibels == 1, and 1996 == 1, then the Armor-Stop siren released in 1996 is 100 decibels loud.

### Constraints:
-   The siren released in 1997 is 10 decibels louder than the siren released in 1996:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the decibel levels for the sirens released in 1997 and 1996, such that the siren released in 1997 is 10 decibels louder than the siren released in 1996. So, the constraints will be of the form:

-   The siren released in 2009 is either the Armor-Stop or the Viking 5:
    This is a constraint that states that the siren released in 2009 is either the Armor-Stop or the Viking 5, but not both. So:

    This is a constraint that states that the siren released in 1997 is either the Soundarm or the Viking 5, but not both. So:

Clues:
The one who had the cafe americano paid 1 dollar more than the one who had the cafe latte.
Hope paid $8.
Norman paid less than Opal.
The one who had the cafe americano paid less than Linda.
The one who had the cafe mocha paid 2 dollars more than Norman.

Entities:
names: Hope, Linda, Norman, Opal
prices: $5, $6, $7, $8
drinks: cafe americano, cafe latte, cafe mocha, espresso
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Hope == 1, and $8 == 1, and CafeLatte == 1, then Hope paid $8 for a cafe latte.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the customers: Hope, Linda, Norman, Opal (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Prices paid by the customers: Price5, Price6, Price7, Price8 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Types of the drinks: CafeAmericano, CafeLatte, CafeMocha, Espresso (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The one who had the cafe americano paid 1 dollar more than the one who had the cafe latte:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the prices for the one who had the cafe americano and the one who had the cafe latte, such that the cafe americano's price is 1 dollar more than the cafe latte's price. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == CafeAmericano and p2 == CafeLatte => p1_to_int == p2_to_int + 1, for all p1, p2 in prices.

-   Hope paid $8:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Hope == Price8.

-   Norman paid less than Opal:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the prices for Norman and Opal, such that Norman's price is less than Opal's price. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Norman and p2 == Opal => p1_to_int < p2_to_int, for all p1, p2 in prices.

-   The one who had the cafe americano paid less than Linda:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the prices for the one who had the cafe americano and Linda, such that the cafe americano's price is less than Linda's price. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == CafeAmericano and p2 == Linda => p1_to_int < p2_to_int, for all p1, p2 in prices.

-   The one who had the cafe mocha paid 2 dollars more than Norman:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the prices for the one who had the cafe mocha and Norman, such that the cafe mocha's price is 2 dollars more than Norman's price. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == CafeMocha and p2 == Norman => p1_to_int == p2_to_int + 2, for all p1, p2 in prices.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Hope == 1, and $8 == 1, and CafeLatte == 1, then Hope paid $8 for a cafe latte.

    Hope == Price8.

-   Norman paid less than Opal:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the prices for Norman and Opal, such that Norman's price is less than Opal's price. So, the constraints will be of the form:

Clues:
The ring with the aquamarine cost less than the piece with the diamond.
Opal's ring is either the piece that cost $1300 or the piece with the diamond.
The piece that cost $1400 is either the ring with the ruby or Hazel's ring.
Hazel's ring has the diamond.
Becky's piece cost more than the ring with the diamond.

Entities:
customers: Becky, Hazel, Opal, Yolanda
prices: $1100, $1200, $1300, $1400
stones: aquamarine, diamond, ruby, topaz
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same quartet. For example, if Becky == 1, and Price1100 == 1, and Aquamarine == 1, then Becky's piece costs $1100 and has the aquamarine stone.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the customers: Becky, Hazel, Opal, Yolanda (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Prices of the pieces: Price1100, Price1200, Price1300, Price1400 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Stones in the pieces: Aquamarine, Diamond, Ruby, Topaz (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The ring with the aquamarine cost less than the piece with the diamond:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of prices to the ring with the aquamarine and the piece with the diamond, such that the aquamarine ring's price is less than the diamond piece's price. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Aquamarine and p2 == Diamond => p1_to_int < p2_to_int, for all p1, p2 in prices.

-   Opal's ring is either the piece that cost $1300 or the piece with the diamond:
    This is a constraint that states that Opal's piece is either the one that costs $1300 or the one with the diamond stone, but not both. So:
    Xor([Opal == Price1300, Opal == Diamond]).

-   The piece that cost $1400 is either the ring with the ruby or Hazel's ring:
    This is a constraint that states that the piece that costs $1400 is either the ring with the ruby or Hazel's ring, but not both. So:
    Xor([Price1400 == Ruby, Price1400 == Hazel]).

-   Hazel's ring has the diamond:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Hazel == Diamond.

-   Becky's piece cost more than the ring with the diamond:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of prices to Becky's piece and the ring with the diamond, such that Becky's piece's price is greater than the diamond ring's price. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Becky and p2 == Diamond => p1_to_int > p2_to_int, for all p1, p2 in prices.

    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Hazel == Diamond.

-   Becky's piece cost more than the ring with the diamond:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of prices to Becky's piece and the ring with the diamond, such that Becky's piece's price is greater than the diamond ring's price. So, the constraints will be of the form:

Clues:
Winifred spoke for a somewhat shorter time than Omar.
Neal talked about Diocletian.
The four students were the presenter who spoke for 8 minutes, the student who gave the presentation on Galerius, Neal and Vickie.
The student who gave the presentation on Nero spoke 2 minutes more than Vickie.
Omar was either the presenter who gave the presentation on Nero or the presenter who spoke for 10 minutes.

Entities:
names: Neal, Omar, Vickie, Winifred
lengths: 6 minutes, 8 minutes, 10 minutes, 12 minutes
emperors: Diocletian, Galerius, Licinius, Nero
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Neal == 1, and 6minutes == 1, and Diocletian == 1, then Neal talked about Diocletian for 6 minutes.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the presenters: Neal, Omar, Vickie, Winifred (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Lengths of the presentations: Length6, Length8, Length10, Length12 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Emperors discussed: Diocletian, Galerius, Licinius, Nero (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   Winifred spoke for a somewhat shorter time than Omar:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the lengths for Winifred and Omar, such that Winifred's length is somewhat shorter than Omar's length. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    l1 == Winifred and l2 == Omar => l1_to_int < l2_to_int, for all l1, l2 in lengths.

-   Neal talked about Diocletian:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Neal == Diocletian.

-   The four students were the presenter who spoke for 8 minutes, the student who gave the presentation on Galerius, Neal, and Vickie:
    This is a constraint that states that all these entities are different, thus:
    AllDifferent([Length8, Galerius, Neal, Vickie]).

-   The student who gave the presentation on Nero spoke 2 minutes more than Vickie:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the lengths for the student who gave the presentation on Nero and Vickie, such that the Nero presenter's length is 2 minutes more than Vickie's length. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    l1 == Nero and l2 == Vickie => l1_to_int == l2_to_int + 2, for all l1, l2 in lengths.

-   Omar was either the presenter who gave the presentation on Nero or the presenter who spoke for 10 minutes:
    This is a constraint that states that Omar's length is either 10 minutes or Omar is the presenter who gave the presentation on Nero, but not both. So:
    Xor([Omar == Length10, Omar == Nero]).
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Neal == 1, and 6minutes == 1, and Diocletian == 1, then Neal talked about Diocletian for 6 minutes.

-   Lengths of the presentations: Length6, Length8, Length10, Length12 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Emperors discussed: Diocletian, Galerius, Licinius, Nero (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   Winifred spoke for a somewhat shorter time than Omar:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the lengths for Winifred and Omar, such that Winifred's length is somewhat shorter than Omar's length. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    l1 == Winifred and l2 == Omar => l1_to_int < l2_to_int, for all l1, l2 in lengths.

-   Neal talked about Diocletian:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Neal == Diocletian.

-   The four students were the presenter who spoke for 8 minutes, the student who gave the presentation on Galerius, Neal, and Vickie:
    This is a constraint that states that all these entities are different, thus:
    AllDifferent([Length8, Galerius, Neal, Vickie]).

-   The student who gave the presentation on Nero spoke 2 minutes more than Vickie:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the lengths for the student who gave the presentation on Nero and Vickie, such that the Nero presenter's length is 2 minutes more than Vickie's length. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    l1 == Nero and l2 == Vickie => l1_to_int == l2_to_int + 2, for all l1, l2 in lengths.

-   Omar was either the presenter who gave the presentation on Nero or the presenter who spoke for 10 minutes:
    This is a constraint that states that Omar's length is either 10 minutes or Omar is the presenter who gave the presentation on Nero, but not both. So:
    Xor([Omar == Length10, Omar == Nero]).

Clues:
Rosa paid somewhat more than the customer who got picked up at the Smith Tower.
The client with the $9 fare was picked up at the Smith Tower.
Neil paid 3 dollars more than Rosa.
The customer who got picked up at the Fremont Library was either the client with the $9 fare or Della.
The person with the $15 fare was picked up at the Neptune Theatre.

Entities:
customers: Della, Neil, Rosa, Sara
fares: $6, $9, $12, $15
pickup points: Arctic Building, Fremont Library, Neptune Theatre, Smith Tower
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same quartet. For example, if Della == 1, and Fare6 == 1, and ArcticBuilding == 1, then Della paid $6 and got picked up at the Arctic Building.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the customers: Della, Neil, Rosa, Sara (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Fares paid by the customers: Fare6, Fare9, Fare12, Fare15 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Pickup points: ArcticBuilding, FremontLibrary, NeptuneTheatre, SmithTower (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   Rosa paid somewhat more than the customer who got picked up at the Smith Tower:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of fares to Rosa and the customer picked up at the Smith Tower, such that Rosa's fare is somewhat more than the customer's fare. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    f1 == Rosa and f2 == SmithTower => f1_to_int > f2_to_int, for all f1, f2 in fares.

-   The client with the $9 fare was picked up at the Smith Tower:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Fare9 == SmithTower.

-   Neil paid 3 dollars more than Rosa:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of fares to Neil and Rosa, such that Neil's fare is 3 dollars more than Rosa's fare. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    f1 == Neil and f2 == Rosa => f1_to_int == f2_to_int + 3, for all f1, f2 in fares.

-   The customer who got picked up at the Fremont Library was either the client with the $9 fare or Della:
    This is a constraint that states that the customer picked up at the Fremont Library is either the client with the $9 fare or Della, but not both. So:
    Xor([FremontLibrary == Fare9, FremontLibrary == Della]).

-   The person with the $15 fare was picked up at the Neptune Theatre:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Fare15 == NeptuneTheatre.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same quartet. For example, if Della == 1, and Fare6 == 1, and ArcticBuilding == 1, then Della paid $6 and got picked up at the Arctic Building.

-   The client with the $9 fare was picked up at the Smith Tower:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Fare9 == SmithTower.

-   Neil paid 3 dollars more than Rosa:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of fares to Neil and Rosa, such that Neil's fare is 3 dollars more than Rosa's fare. So, the constraints will be of the form:

-   The customer who got picked up at the Fremont Library was either the client with the $9 fare or Della:
    This is a constraint that states that the customer picked up at the Fremont Library is either the client with the $9 fare or Della, but not both. So:
    Xor([FremontLibrary == Fare9, FremontLibrary == Della]).

Clues:
Evan threw the orange darts.
The player who threw the violet darts scored 7 points higher than Ira.
Ira finished with 41 points.
The player who threw the white darts finished 14 points lower than Rudy.

Entities:
players: Evan, Ira, Rudy, Zachary
scores: 41, 48, 55, 62
colors: gray, orange, violet, white
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Evan == 1, and 41 == 1, and Orange == 1, then Evan threw the orange darts and finished with 41 points.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the players: Evan, Ira, Rudy, Zachary (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Scores of the players: Score41, Score48, Score55, Score62 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Colors of the darts: Gray, Orange, Violet, White (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   Evan threw the orange darts:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Evan == Orange.

-   The player who threw the violet darts scored 7 points higher than Ira:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the scores for the player who threw the violet darts and Ira, such that the player who threw the violet darts scored 7 points higher than Ira. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    s1 == Violet and s2 == Ira => s1_to_int == s2_to_int + 7, for all s1, s2 in scores.

-   Ira finished with 41 points:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Ira == Score41.

-   The player who threw the white darts finished 14 points lower than Rudy:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the scores for the player who threw the white darts and Rudy, such that the player who threw the white darts finished 14 points lower than Rudy. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    s1 == White and s2 == Rudy => s1_to_int == s2_to_int - 14, for all s1, s2 in scores.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Evan == 1, and 41 == 1, and Orange == 1, then Evan threw the orange darts and finished with 41 points.

-   Ira finished with 41 points:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Ira == Score41.

-   The player who threw the white darts finished 14 points lower than Rudy:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the scores for the player who threw the white darts and Rudy, such that the player who threw the white darts finished 14 points lower than Rudy. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    s1 == White and s2 == Rudy => s1_to_int == s2_to_int - 14, for all s1, s2 in scores.

Clues:
The 200 page project is either the book published in 2011 or the book published in 2010.
The book published in 2011 is either Orlando's project or Jan's project.
The book published in 2007 is 25 pages shorter than the book published in 2002.
The four projects are the book published in 2007, the 225 page assignment, Suzanne's project and the 175 page assignment.
Jan's assignment is 175 pages long.

Entities:
translators: Ebony, Jan, Orlando, Suzanne
pages: 150 pages, 175 pages, 200 pages, 225 pages
years: 2002, 2007, 2010, 2011
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Ebony == 1, and 150pages == 1, and 2007 == 1, then Ebony's project is a 150-page book published in 2007.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the translators: Ebony, Jan, Orlando, Suzanne (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Number of pages in the projects: Pages150, Pages175, Pages200, Pages225 (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The 200 page project is either the book published in 2011 or the book published in 2010:
    This is a constraint that states that the 200-page project is either published in 2011 or in 2010, but not both. So:
    Xor([Pages200 == Year2011, Pages200 == Year2010]).

-   The book published in 2011 is either Orlando's project or Jan's project:
    This is a constraint that states that the book published in 2011 is either Orlando's project or Jan's project, but not both. So:
    Xor([Year2011 == Orlando, Year2011 == Jan]).

-   The book published in 2007 is 25 pages shorter than the book published in 2002:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the number of pages for the book published in 2007 and 2002, such that the book published in 2007 is 25 pages shorter than the book published in 2002. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Year2007 and p2 == Year2002 => p1_to_int == p2_to_int - 25, for all p1, p2 in pages.

-   The four projects are the book published in 2007, the 225 page assignment, Suzanne's project, and the 175 page assignment:
    This is a constraint that states that all these entities are different, thus:
    AllDifferent([Year2007, Pages225, Suzanne, Pages175]).

-   Jan's assignment is 175 pages long:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Jan == Pages175.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Ebony == 1, and 150pages == 1, and 2007 == 1, then Ebony's project is a 150-page book published in 2007.

### Decision variables:

### Constraints:
-   The 200 page project is either the book published in 2011 or the book published in 2010:
    This is a constraint that states that the 200-page project is either published in 2011 or in 2010, but not both. So:
    Xor([Pages200 == Year2011, Pages200 == Year2010]).

-   The book published in 2011 is either Orlando's project or Jan's project:
    This is a constraint that states that the book published in 2011 is either Orlando's project or Jan's project, but not both. So:
    Xor([Year2011 == Orlando, Year2011 == Jan]).

-   The book published in 2007 is 25 pages shorter than the book published in 2002:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the number of pages for the book published in 2007 and 2002, such that the book published in 2007 is 25 pages shorter than the book published in 2002. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Year2007 and p2 == Year2002 => p1_to_int == p2_to_int - 25, for all p1, p2 in pages.

cake shapes: baseball glove, bowling pin, sports car, turtle
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Danielson == 1, and October5 == 1, and BaseballGlove == 1, then Mrs. Danielson's baseball glove-shaped cake will be delivered on October 5.

### Constraints:
-   Mrs. Danielson's cake will be delivered 1 day before the order shaped like a sports car:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the delivery dates for Mrs. Danielson's cake and the sports car-shaped order, such that Mrs. Danielson's cake's delivery date is 1 day before the sports car-shaped order's delivery date. So, the constraints will be of the form:

-   The order shaped like a turtle will be delivered 2 days before Mrs. Ingram's cake:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the delivery dates for the turtle-shaped order and Mrs. Ingram's cake, such that the turtle-shaped order's delivery date is 2 days before Mrs. Ingram's cake's delivery date. So, the constraints will be of the form:

    This is a constraint that states that the cake shaped like a bowling pin is either delivered on October 5 or is Mrs. Ingram's cake, but not both. So:
    Xor([BowlingPin == October5, BowlingPin == Ingram]).

-   Mrs. Nolan's cake will be in the shape of a sports car:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Nolan == SportsCar.

Clues:
Of Ingram Arena and Noble Arena, one holds 150 people and the other is set up for rugby games.
The lacrosse facility holds 40 more people than Wilcox Arena.
Ingram Arena holds 230 people.
Wilcox Arena holds 80 fewer people than the soccer facility.

Entities:
arenas: Frederick, Ingram, Noble, Wilcox
capacities: 110, 150, 190, 230
sports: basketball, lacrosse, rugby, soccer
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Frederick == 1, and 110 == 1, and Basketball == 1, then Frederick is the basketball facility with a capacity of 110 people.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the arenas: Frederick, Ingram, Noble, Wilcox (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Capacities of the arenas: Capacity110, Capacity150, Capacity190, Capacity230 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Types of sports: Basketball, Lacrosse, Rugby, Soccer (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   Of Ingram Arena and Noble Arena, one holds 150 people and the other is set up for rugby games:
    This is a constraint that states that for the capacities of 150 people and rugby games, one is associated with Ingram Arena and the other with Noble Arena, but not both. So:
    Xor([
        (Capacity150 == Ingram, Rugby == Noble),
        (Capacity150 == Noble, Rugby == Ingram)
    ]).

-   The lacrosse facility holds 40 more people than Wilcox Arena:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the capacities for the lacrosse facility and Wilcox Arena, such that the lacrosse facility's capacity is 40 more than Wilcox Arena's capacity. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    c1 == Lacrosse and c2 == Wilcox => c1_to_int == c2_to_int + 40, for all c1, c2 in capacities.

-   Ingram Arena holds 230 people:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Ingram == Capacity230.

-   Wilcox Arena holds 80 fewer people than the soccer facility:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the capacities for Wilcox Arena and the soccer facility, such that Wilcox Arena's capacity is 80 less than the soccer facility's capacity. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    c1 == Wilcox and c2 == Soccer => c1_to_int == c2_to_int - 80, for all c1, c2 in capacities.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Frederick == 1, and 110 == 1, and Basketball == 1, then Frederick is the basketball facility with a capacity of 110 people.

### Decision variables:

-   The lacrosse facility holds 40 more people than Wilcox Arena:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the capacities for the lacrosse facility and Wilcox Arena, such that the lacrosse facility's capacity is 40 more than Wilcox Arena's capacity. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    c1 == Lacrosse and c2 == Wilcox => c1_to_int == c2_to_int + 40, for all c1, c2 in capacities.

-   Ingram Arena holds 230 people:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Ingram == Capacity230.

-   Wilcox Arena holds 80 fewer people than the soccer facility:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the capacities for Wilcox Arena and the soccer facility, such that Wilcox Arena's capacity is 80 less than the soccer facility's capacity. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    c1 == Wilcox and c2 == Soccer => c1_to_int == c2_to_int - 80, for all c1, c2 in capacities.

The Whitehead's structure sold for $29,000.
The Kirby's house is 15 sq ft smaller than the $35,000 house.
The $36,000 house is somewhat smaller than the Gillespie's structure.
Of the 110 sq ft home and the 140 sq ft home, one sold for $35,000 and the other is for the Gillespies.

prices: $25,000, $29,000, $35,000, $36,000
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same quartet. For example, if Gillespie == 1, and 95sqft == 1, and Price25000 == 1, then the Gillespie's structure is 95 sq ft and sold for $25,000.

### Constraints:
-   The $35,000 structure is 15 sq ft smaller than the $29,000 home:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of square footage for the $35,000 structure and the $29,000 home, such that the $35,000 structure is 15 sq ft smaller than the $29,000 home. So, the constraints will be of the form:

    This is a constraint that states that for the 110 sq ft home and the 140 sq ft home, one sold for $35,000 and the other is for the Gillespies, but not both. So:
    Xor([

Clues:
The project on the Serenity starts 1 month after Stacy's project.
Darryl's project starts 1 month after Gene's assignment.
The study beginning in April is either the study on the Liberty or the project on the Pegasus.
Lauren's project is on the Pegasus.

Entities:
students: Darryl, Gene, Lauren, Stacy
months: March, April, May, June
ships: Liberty, Osprey, Pegasus, Serenity
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Darryl == 1, and March == 1, and Liberty == 1, then Darryl's project is on the Liberty and starts in March.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the students: Darryl, Gene, Lauren, Stacy (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Start months of the projects: March, April, May, June (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Names of the ships: Liberty, Osprey, Pegasus, Serenity (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The project on the Serenity starts 1 month after Stacy's project:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the start months for the project on the Serenity and Stacy's project, such that the Serenity's project start month is 1 month after Stacy's project start month. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == Serenity and m2 == Stacy => m1_to_int == m2_to_int + 1, for all m1, m2 in months.

-   Darryl's project starts 1 month after Gene's assignment:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the start months for Darryl's project and Gene's assignment, such that Darryl's project start month is 1 month after Gene's assignment start month. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == Darryl and m2 == Gene => m1_to_int == m2_to_int + 1, for all m1, m2 in months.

-   The study beginning in April is either the study on the Liberty or the project on the Pegasus:
    This is a constraint that states that the study beginning in April is either on the Liberty or the Pegasus, but not both. So:
    Xor([Liberty == April, Pegasus == April]).

-   Lauren's project is on the Pegasus:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Lauren == Pegasus.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Darryl == 1, and March == 1, and Liberty == 1, then Darryl's project is on the Liberty and starts in March.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the students: Darryl, Gene, Lauren, Stacy (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Start months of the projects: March, April, May, June (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Names of the ships: Liberty, Osprey, Pegasus, Serenity (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The project on the Serenity starts 1 month after Stacy's project:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the start months for the project on the Serenity and Stacy's project, such that the Serenity's project start month is 1 month after Stacy's project start month. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == Serenity and m2 == Stacy => m1_to_int == m2_to_int + 1, for all m1, m2 in months.

-   Darryl's project starts 1 month after Gene's assignment:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the start months for Darryl's project and Gene's assignment, such that Darryl's project start month is 1 month after Gene's assignment start month. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == Darryl and m2 == Gene => m1_to_int == m2_to_int + 1, for all m1, m2 in months.

-   The study beginning in April is either the study on the Liberty or the project on the Pegasus:
    This is a constraint that states that the study beginning in April is either on the Liberty or the Pegasus, but not both. So:
    Xor([Liberty == April, Pegasus == April]).

-   Lauren's project is on the Pegasus:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Lauren == Pegasus.

Clues:
Zimmerman is from the Wolverines.

The player from the Checkers scored 1 goal more than Walls.

Entities:

So, the constraints will be of the form:
    g1 == IceHogs and g2 == Wolverines => g1_to_int == g2_to_int - 1, for all g1, g2 in goals.

-   Klein had 9 goals this season:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Klein == Goals9.

-   The player from the Checkers scored 1 goal more than Walls:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the number of goals for the player from the Checkers and Walls, such that the Checkers player's number of goals is 1 more than Walls's number of goals. So, the constraints will be of the form:

Clues:
Of the bird bought in February and the bird bought in January, one is Gladys's and the other is the macaw.
The macaw was bought 2 months before Ellen's pet.
The parakeet was bought 1 month after the finch.
Alberta's pet was bought 1 month before Gladys's pet.
The finch was bought sometime after the lovebird.

Entities:
names: Alberta, Della, Ellen, Gladys
months: January, February, March, April
birds: finch, lovebird, macaw, parakeet
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Alberta == 1, and January == 1, and Finch == 1, then Alberta's pet is a finch bought in January.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the owners: Alberta, Della, Ellen, Gladys (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Months of purchase: January, February, March, April (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Types of birds: Finch, Lovebird, Macaw, Parakeet (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   Of the bird bought in February and the bird bought in January, one is Gladys's and the other is the macaw:
    This is a constraint that states that for the birds bought in February and January, one is Gladys's and the other is the macaw, but not both. So:
    Xor([
        (February == Gladys and January == Macaw),
        (January == Gladys and February == Macaw)
    ]).

-   The macaw was bought 2 months before Ellen's pet:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months of purchase for the macaw and Ellen's pet, such that the macaw was bought 2 months before Ellen's pet. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == Macaw and m2 == Ellen => m1_to_int == m2_to_int + 2, for all m1, m2 in months of purchase.

-   The parakeet was bought 1 month after the finch:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months of purchase for the parakeet and the finch, such that the parakeet was bought 1 month after the finch. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == Parakeet and m2 == Finch => m1_to_int == m2_to_int + 1, for all m1, m2 in months of purchase.

-   Alberta's pet was bought 1 month before Gladys's pet:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months of purchase for Alberta's pet and Gladys's pet, such that Alberta's pet was bought 1 month before Gladys's pet. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == Alberta and m2 == Gladys => m1_to_int == m2_to_int - 1, for all m1, m2 in months of purchase.

-   The finch was bought sometime after the lovebird:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months of purchase for the finch and the lovebird, such that the finch was bought sometime after the lovebird. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == Finch and m2 == Lovebird => m1_to_int > m2_to_int, for all m1, m2 in months of purchase.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Alberta == 1, and January == 1, and Finch == 1, then Alberta's pet is a finch bought in January.

### Constraints:
-   Of the bird bought in February and the bird bought in January, one is Gladys's and the other is the macaw:
    This is a constraint that states that for the birds bought in February and January, one is Gladys's and the other is the macaw, but not both. So:
    Xor([
        (February == Gladys and January == Macaw),
        (January == Gladys and February == Macaw)
    ]).

-   The macaw was bought 2 months before Ellen's pet:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months of purchase for the macaw and Ellen's pet, such that the macaw was bought 2 months before Ellen's pet. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == Macaw and m2 == Ellen => m1_to_int == m2_to_int + 2, for all m1, m2 in months of purchase.

-   The parakeet was bought 1 month after the finch:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months of purchase for the parakeet and the finch, such that the parakeet was bought 1 month after the finch. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == Parakeet and m2 == Finch => m1_to_int == m2_to_int + 1, for all m1, m2 in months of purchase.

-   Alberta's pet was bought 1 month before Gladys's pet:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months of purchase for Alberta's pet and Gladys's pet, such that Alberta's pet was bought 1 month before Gladys's pet. So, the constraints will be of the form:

The project headed by Dr. Ewing will go online sometime before the Zynga Complex.
Of the project headed by Dr. Ewing and the facility scheduled to go online in 2018, one is the Egert Facility and the other is the Tevatron LHC.

### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if EgertFacility == 1, and 2016 == 1, and DrBaldwin == 1, then the Egert Facility project, headed by Dr. Baldwin, will go online in 2016.

### Decision variables:

-   Names of the scientists: DrBaldwin, DrEwing, DrKirk, DrQuinn (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The Tevatron LHC is either the facility scheduled to go online in 2019 or the accelerator scheduled to go online in 2016:
    This is a constraint that states that the Tevatron LHC is either in 2019 or in 2016, but not both. So:
    Xor([TevatronLHC == Year2019, TevatronLHC == Year2016]).

-   Of the project headed by Dr. Baldwin and the project headed by Dr. Quinn, one is the Falston LCS and the other will go online in 2017:
    This is a constraint that states that one of the projects is the Falston LCS and the other goes online in 2017. So:
    Xor([
        (DrBaldwin == FalstonLCS, DrQuinn == Year2017),
        (DrBaldwin == Year2017, DrQuinn == FalstonLCS)
    ]).

-   The project headed by Dr. Ewing will go online sometime before the Zynga Complex:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the years for Dr. Ewing's project and the Zynga Complex, such that Dr. Ewing's project's year is less than the Zynga Complex's year. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    y1 == DrEwing and y2 == ZyngaComplex => y1_to_int < y2_to_int, for all y1, y2 in years.

-   Of the project headed by Dr. Ewing and the facility scheduled to go online in 2018, one is the Egert Facility and the other is the Tevatron LHC:
    This is a constraint that states that one of the projects is the Egert Facility and the other is the Tevatron LHC. So:

### Constraints:
-   The Tevatron LHC is either the facility scheduled to go online in 2019 or the accelerator scheduled to go online in 2016:
    This is a constraint that states that the Tevatron LHC is either in 2019 or in 2016, but not both. So:

-   Of the project headed by Dr. Baldwin and the project headed by Dr. Quinn, one is the Falston LCS and the other will go online in 2017:
    This is a constraint that states that one of the projects is the Falston LCS and the other goes online in 2017. So:

    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the years for Dr. Ewing's project and the Zynga Complex, such that Dr. Ewing's project's year is less than the Zynga Complex's year. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    y1 == DrEwing and y2 == ZyngaComplex => y1_to_int < y2_to_int, for all y1, y2 in years.

-   Of the project headed by Dr. Ewing and the facility scheduled to go online in 2018, one is the Egert Facility and the other is the Tevatron LHC:
    This is a constraint that states that one of the projects is the Egert Facility and the other is the Tevatron LHC. So:

Clues:
The 2004 holiday is either the skydiving holiday or the holiday with Yvonne.
Of the kayaking holiday and the trip with Isabel, one was in 2001 and the other was in 2004.
The vacation with Andy was after the trip with Yvonne.
The holiday with Bill was 1 year after the trip with Andy.
The cycling trip was before the hunting vacation.

Entities:
friends: Andy, Bill, Isabel, Yvonne
years: 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004
activities: cycling, hunting, kayaking, skydiving
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Andy == 1, and 2001 == 1, and Cycling == 1, then Andy went on a cycling trip in 2001.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the friends: Andy, Bill, Isabel, Yvonne (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Years of the holidays: Year2001, Year2002, Year2003, Year2004 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Activities of the holidays: Cycling, Hunting, Kayaking, Skydiving (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The 2004 holiday is either the skydiving holiday or the holiday with Yvonne:
    This is a constraint that states that the 2004 holiday is either skydiving or with Yvonne, but not both. So:
    Xor([Year2004 == Skydiving, Year2004 == Yvonne]).

-   Of the kayaking holiday and the trip with Isabel, one was in 2001 and the other was in 2004:
    This is a constraint that states that one of the kayaking holiday and the trip with Isabel was in 2001 and the other was in 2004. So:
    Xor([Year2001 == Kayaking, Year2004 == Isabel]).

-   The vacation with Andy was after the trip with Yvonne:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the years for the vacation with Andy and the trip with Yvonne, such that the vacation with Andy was after the trip with Yvonne. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    y1 == Andy and y2 == Yvonne => y1_to_int > y2_to_int, for all y1, y2 in years.

-   The holiday with Bill was 1 year after the trip with Andy:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the years for the holiday with Bill and the trip with Andy, such that the holiday with Bill was 1 year after the trip with Andy. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    y1 == Bill and y2 == Andy => y1_to_int == y2_to_int + 1, for all y1, y2 in years.

-   The cycling trip was before the hunting vacation:
    This is a constraint that states that the cycling trip was before the hunting vacation. So:
    Cycling < Hunting.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Andy == 1, and 2001 == 1, and Cycling == 1, then Andy went on a cycling trip in 2001.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the friends: Andy, Bill, Isabel, Yvonne (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Years of the holidays: Year2001, Year2002, Year2003, Year2004 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Activities of the holidays: Cycling, Hunting, Kayaking, Skydiving (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The 2004 holiday is either the skydiving holiday or the holiday with Yvonne:
    This is a constraint that states that the 2004 holiday is either skydiving or with Yvonne, but not both. So:
    Xor([Year2004 == Skydiving, Year2004 == Yvonne]).

-   Of the kayaking holiday and the trip with Isabel, one was in 2001 and the other was in 2004:
    This is a constraint that states that one of the kayaking holiday and the trip with Isabel was in 2001 and the other was in 2004. So:
    Xor([Year2001 == Kayaking, Year2004 == Isabel]).

-   The vacation with Andy was after the trip with Yvonne:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the years for the vacation with Andy and the trip with Yvonne, such that the vacation with Andy was after the trip with Yvonne. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    y1 == Andy and y2 == Yvonne => y1_to_int > y2_to_int, for all y1, y2 in years.

-   The holiday with Bill was 1 year after the trip with Andy:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the years for the holiday with Bill and the trip with Andy, such that the holiday with Bill was 1 year after the trip with Andy. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    y1 == Bill and y2 == Andy => y1_to_int == y2_to_int + 1, for all y1, y2 in years.

-   The cycling trip was before the hunting vacation:
    This is a constraint that states that the cycling trip was before the hunting vacation. So:
    Cycling < Hunting.

Clues:
Ginger was either the person who paid $160 or Vicki's client.
Beulah paid 10 dollars more than Yvonne's client.
Hannah paid less than Debra.
Vicki's client paid more than Debra.
Debra paid less than Pam's client.

Entities:
clients: Beulah, Debra, Ginger, Hannah
prices: $150, $160, $170, $180
masseuses: Lynda, Pam, Vicki, Yvonne
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Beulah == 1, and Price150 == 1, and Lynda == 1, then Beulah paid $150 to Lynda.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the clients: Beulah, Debra, Ginger, Hannah (all different, 1 to 4)

-   Names of the masseuses: Lynda, Pam, Vicki, Yvonne (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   Ginger was either the person who paid $160 or Vicki's client:
    This is a constraint that states that Ginger is either the person who paid $160 or Vicki's client, but not both. So:
    Xor([Ginger == Price160, Ginger == Vicki]).

-   Beulah paid 10 dollars more than Yvonne's client:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of prices to Beulah and Yvonne's client, such that Beulah's price is 10 dollars more than Yvonne's client's price. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Beulah and p2 == Yvonne => p1_to_int == p2_to_int + 10, for all p1, p2 in prices.

-   Hannah paid less than Debra:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of prices to Hannah and Debra, such that Hannah's price is less than Debra's price. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Hannah and p2 == Debra => p1_to_int < p2_to_int, for all p1, p2 in prices.

-   Vicki's client paid more than Debra:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of prices to Vicki's client and Debra, such that Vicki's client's price is more than Debra's price. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Vicki and p2 == Debra => p1_to_int > p2_to_int, for all p1, p2 in prices.

-   Debra paid less than Pam's client:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of prices to Debra and Pam's client, such that Debra's price is less than Pam's client's price. So, the constraints will be of the form:
