Clues:
The person who had the port paid 1 dollar more than Kurt.
Of the person who paid $25 and the person who paid $24, one was Priscilla and the other had the shiraz.
Of the person who paid $27 and Priscilla, one had the chianti and the other had the port.
Isabel paid $25.

Entities:
wines: chianti, port, riesling, shiraz
prices: $24, $25, $26, $27
names: Isabel, Kurt, Priscilla, Robin
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Isabel == 1, and Price25 == 1, and Chianti == 1, then Isabel paid $25 for the chianti.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the persons: Isabel, Kurt, Priscilla, Robin (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Wines purchased: Chianti, Port, Riesling, Shiraz (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Prices paid: Price24, Price25, Price26, Price27 (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The person who had the port paid 1 dollar more than Kurt:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of prices for the person who had the port and Kurt, such that the price paid for the port is 1 more than Kurt's price. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Port and p2 == Kurt => p1_to_int == p2_to_int + 1, for all p1, p2 in prices.

-   Of the person who paid $25 and the person who paid $24, one was Priscilla and the other had the shiraz:
    This is a constraint that states that one person paid $25 and the other paid $24, and one of them is Priscilla and the other had the shiraz. So, we will have:
    (Price25 == Priscilla and Price24 == Shiraz) or (Price24 == Priscilla and Price25 == Shiraz).

-   Of the person who paid $27 and Priscilla, one had the chianti and the other had the port:
    This is a constraint that states that one person paid $27 and the other is Priscilla, and one of them had the chianti and the other had the port. So, we will have:
    (Price27 == Chianti and Priscilla == Port) or (Priscilla == Chianti and Price27 == Port).

-   Isabel paid $25:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Isabel == Price25.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Isabel == 1, and Price25 == 1, and Chianti == 1, then Isabel paid $25 for the chianti.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the persons: Isabel, Kurt, Priscilla, Robin (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Wines purchased: Chianti, Port, Riesling, Shiraz (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Prices paid: Price24, Price25, Price26, Price27 (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The person who had the port paid 1 dollar more than Kurt:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of prices for the person who had the port and Kurt, such that the price paid for the port is 1 more than Kurt's price. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Port and p2 == Kurt => p1_to_int == p2_to_int + 1, for all p1, p2 in prices.

-   Of the person who paid $25 and the person who paid $24, one was Priscilla and the other had the shiraz:
    This is a constraint that states that one person paid $25 and the other paid $24, and one of them is Priscilla and the other had the shiraz. So, we will have:
    (Price25 == Priscilla and Price24 == Shiraz) or (Price24 == Priscilla and Price25 == Shiraz).

-   Of the person who paid $27 and Priscilla, one had the chianti and the other had the port:
    This is a constraint that states that one person paid $27 and the other is Priscilla, and one of them had the chianti and the other had the port. So, we will have:
    (Price27 == Chianti and Priscilla == Port) or (Priscilla == Chianti and Price27 == Port).

-   Isabel paid $25:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Isabel == Price25.

The friend who lost 3 pounds used the low-fat diet.
Mandy lost 2 fewer pounds than Raymond.
Mandy lost 4 more pounds than Tom.
The dieter who used the vegan diet is either Mandy or the friend who lost 3 pounds.

Entities:
pounds lost: 3, 5, 7, 9
diets: dairy-free, gluten-free, low-fat, vegan
names: Celia, Mandy, Raymond, Tom
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Celia == 1, and 3Pounds == 1, and DairyFree == 1, then Celia lost 3 pounds using the dairy-free diet.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the individuals: Celia, Mandy, Raymond, Tom (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Pounds lost: 3, 5, 7, 9 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Diets used: DairyFree, GlutenFree, LowFat, Vegan (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   Celia used the gluten-free diet:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:

-   The friend who lost 3 pounds used the low-fat diet:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    3Pounds == LowFat.

-   Mandy lost 2 fewer pounds than Raymond:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of pounds lost for Mandy and Raymond, such that Mandy's pounds lost is 2 less than Raymond's pounds lost. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Mandy and p2 == Raymond => p1_to_int == p2_to_int - 2, for all p1, p2 in pounds lost.

-   Mandy lost 4 more pounds than Tom:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of pounds lost for Mandy and Tom, such that Mandy's pounds lost is 4 more than Tom's pounds lost. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Mandy and p2 == Tom => p1_to_int == p2_to_int + 4, for all p1, p2 in pounds lost.

-   The dieter who used the vegan diet is either Mandy or the friend who lost 3 pounds:
    This is a constraint that states that the dieter who used the vegan diet is either Mandy or the friend who lost 3 pounds, but not both. So:
    Xor([Mandy == Vegan, 3Pounds == Vegan]).
### Plan:

Of the performer who used bowling pins and the juggler who went fourth, one is Melissa and the other is Yolanda.
The juggler who used bowling pins was either Yolanda or the juggler who went second.
Trevor performed 2 spots before the performer who used chainsaws.

Entities:
orders: first, second, third, fourth

### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Melissa == 1, and first == 1, and bowlingPins == 1, then Melissa performed first with bowling pins.

### Constraints:
-   The four people were Shari, the performer who went fourth, the person who used batons, and the performer who went third:
    This is a constraint that states that all these entities are different, thus:
    AllDifferent([Shari, fourth, batons, third]).

-   Of the performer who used bowling pins and the juggler who went fourth, one is Melissa and the other is Yolanda:
    This is a constraint that states that one performer used bowling pins and went fourth, and the other performer is Melissa or Yolanda. So:
    (bowlingPins == fourth and (Melissa == 1 or Yolanda == 1)) or (Melissa == bowlingPins and Yolanda == fourth).

-   The juggler who used bowling pins was either Yolanda or the juggler who went second:
    This is a constraint that states that the juggler who used bowling pins is either Yolanda or the juggler who went second. So:
    (bowlingPins == Yolanda or bowlingPins == second).

-   Trevor performed 2 spots before the performer who used chainsaws:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the orders of performance for Trevor and the performer who used chainsaws, such that Trevor's order is 2 less than the performer who used chainsaws. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    o1 == Trevor and o2 == chainsaws => o1_to_int == o2_to_int - 2, for all o1, o2 in orders.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Melissa == 1, and first == 1, and bowlingPins == 1, then Melissa performed first with bowling pins.

-   Of the performer who used bowling pins and the juggler who went fourth, one is Melissa and the other is Yolanda:
    This is a constraint that states that one performer used bowling pins and went fourth, and the other performer is Melissa or Yolanda. So:
    (bowlingPins == fourth and (Melissa == 1 or Yolanda == 1)) or (Melissa == bowlingPins and Yolanda == fourth).

-   The juggler who used bowling pins was either Yolanda or the juggler who went second:
    This is a constraint that states that the juggler who used bowling pins is either Yolanda or the juggler who went second. So:
    (bowlingPins == Yolanda or bowlingPins == second).

-   Trevor performed 2 spots before the performer who used chainsaws:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the orders of performance for Trevor and the performer who used chainsaws, such that Trevor's order is 2 less than the performer who used chainsaws. So, the constraints will be of the form:

    This is a constraint that states that one of the boxers has 33 wins and the other has 27 wins, and one of them is Sonia and the other has 12 losses. So, the constraints will be:
    (Wins33 == Sonia and Wins27 == 12Losses) or (Wins27 == Sonia and Wins33 == 12Losses).

-   The boxer with 12 losses is either the fighter with 33 wins or Jane:
    This is a constraint that states that the boxer with 12 losses is either the fighter with 33 wins or Jane, but not both. So:

### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Ira == 1, and January == 1, and Cheer == 1, then Ira will publish in January and has been studying the Cheer culture.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the individuals: Ira, Luther, Vera, Yvette (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Months of publication: January, February, March, April (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Cultures studied: Cheer, Garyk, Haleyito, Xozix (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The person who will publish in January is either the person who has been studying the Cheer culture or Ira:
    This is a constraint that states that the person publishing in January is either studying the Cheer culture or is Ira, but not both. So:
    Xor([January == Cheer, January == Ira]).

-   The person who has been studying the Xozix culture will publish 1 month before the person who has been studying the Haleyito culture:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the individuals studying Xozix and Haleyito cultures, such that the Xozix student's publication month is 1 less than the Haleyito student's publication month. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == Xozix and m2 == Haleyito => m1_to_int == m2_to_int - 1, for all m1, m2 in months of publication.

-   Of the student who will publish in March and the person who has been studying the Xozix culture, one is Luther and the other is Yvette:
    This is a constraint that states that one of Luther or Yvette is studying Xozix and the other will publish in March. So:
    (March == Luther and Xozix == Yvette) or (March == Yvette and Xozix == Luther).

-   Vera will publish 1 month before Luther:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months of publication for Vera and Luther, such that Vera's publication month is 1 less than Luther's publication month. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == Vera and m2 == Luther => m1_to_int == m2_to_int - 1, for all m1, m2 in months of publication.

    This is a constraint that states that one of Luther or Yvette is studying Xozix and the other will publish in March. So:
    (March == Luther and Xozix == Yvette) or (March == Yvette and Xozix == Luther).

-   Vera will publish 1 month before Luther:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months of publication for Vera and Luther, such that Vera's publication month is 1 less than Luther's publication month. So, the constraints will be of the form:

-   Ira will leave 1 day before the conductor departing from Manson:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the dates of departure for Ira and the conductor departing from Manson, such that Ira's departure date is 1 less than the conductor's departure date from Manson. So, the constraints will be of the form:

-   The person departing from Buttonwillow will leave 1 day before the conductor departing from Indio:

For example, if Jorge == 1, and LimeGreen == 1, and 1982 == 1, then Jorge is the skydiver who wears the lime green suit and started skydiving in 1982.

    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the starting years for the skydiver who wears the pink suit and Otis, such that the skydiver who wears the pink suit's starting year is 1 less than Otis's starting year. So, the constraints will be of the form:

    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the starting years for the jumper who wears the yellow suit and Philip, such that the jumper who wears the yellow suit's starting year is greater than Philip's starting year. So, the constraints will be of the form:

Clues:
The ambassador with the 9 day visit will leave sometime after Fitzgerald.
Quinn will leave 2 months after Bender.
The person leaving in January is either the ambassador with the 3 day visit or Fitzgerald.
Quinn will leave 1 month before the ambassador with the 7 day visit.

Entities:
diplomats: Bender, Fitzgerald, Owens, Quinn
months: January, February, March, April
durations: 2 day, 3 day, 7 day, 9 day
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Bender == 1, and January == 1, and Day2 == 1, then Bender is the diplomat leaving in January with a 2-day visit.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the diplomats: Bender, Fitzgerald, Owens, Quinn (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Months of departure: January, February, March, April (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Visit durations: Day2, Day3, Day7, Day9 (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The ambassador with the 9-day visit will leave sometime after Fitzgerald:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months of departure for the ambassador with the 9-day visit and Fitzgerald, such that the ambassador with the 9-day visit's month of departure is greater than Fitzgerald's month of departure. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == 9-day ambassador and m2 == Fitzgerald => m1_to_int > m2_to_int, for all m1, m2 in months of departure.

-   Quinn will leave 2 months after Bender:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months of departure for Quinn and Bender, such that Quinn's month of departure is 2 more than Bender's month of departure. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == Quinn and m2 == Bender => m1_to_int == m2_to_int + 2, for all m1, m2 in months of departure.

-   The person leaving in January is either the ambassador with the 3-day visit or Fitzgerald:
    This is a constraint that states that the person leaving in January is either the ambassador with the 3-day visit or Fitzgerald, but not both. So:
    Xor([January == Day3, January == Fitzgerald]).

-   Quinn will leave 1 month before the ambassador with the 7-day visit:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months of departure for Quinn and the ambassador with the 7-day visit, such that Quinn's month of departure is 1 less than the 7-day ambassador's month of departure. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == Quinn and m2 == Day7 => m1_to_int == m2_to_int - 1, for all m1, m2 in months of departure.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Bender == 1, and January == 1, and Day2 == 1, then Bender is the diplomat leaving in January with a 2-day visit.

So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == 9-day ambassador and m2 == Fitzgerald => m1_to_int > m2_to_int, for all m1, m2 in months of departure.

-   Quinn will leave 2 months after Bender:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months of departure for Quinn and Bender, such that Quinn's month of departure is 2 more than Bender's month of departure. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == Quinn and m2 == Bender => m1_to_int == m2_to_int + 2, for all m1, m2 in months of departure.

-   The person leaving in January is either the ambassador with the 3-day visit or Fitzgerald:
    This is a constraint that states that the person leaving in January is either the ambassador with the 3-day visit or Fitzgerald, but not both. So:
    Xor([January == Day3, January == Fitzgerald]).

-   Quinn will leave 1 month before the ambassador with the 7-day visit:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months of departure for Quinn and the ambassador with the 7-day visit, such that Quinn's month of departure is 1 less than the 7-day ambassador's month of departure. So, the constraints will be of the form:

Clues:
Ultra Hex is Gabe Grant.
Criminal Bane is either the hero who started in 2007 or the superhero who started in 2009.
Peter Powers began sometime before Matt Minkle.
Gabe Grant began 1 year after Wonderman.
The four people are Deep Shadow, the superhero who started in 2007, the hero who started in 2009 and Matt Minkle.

Entities:
years: 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010
superheroes: Criminal Bane, Deep Shadow, Ultra Hex, Wonderman
names: Gabe Grant, Ivor Ingram, Matt Minkle, Peter Powers
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if GabeGrant == 1, and 2007 == 1, and DeepShadow == 1, then Gabe Grant is Ultra Hex, started in 2007, and is Deep Shadow.

### Decision variables:
-   Years of starting: 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Superheroes: CriminalBane, DeepShadow, UltraHex, Wonderman (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Names of the heroes: GabeGrant, IvorIngram, MattMinkle, PeterPowers (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   Ultra Hex is Gabe Grant:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    UltraHex == GabeGrant.

-   Criminal Bane is either the hero who started in 2007 or the superhero who started in 2009:
    This is a constraint that states that Criminal Bane's starting year is either 2007 or 2009, but not both. So:
    Xor([CriminalBane == 2007, CriminalBane == 2009]).

-   Peter Powers began sometime before Matt Minkle:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the years for Peter Powers and Matt Minkle, such that Peter Powers' starting year is less than Matt Minkle's starting year. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    y1 == PeterPowers and y2 == MattMinkle => y1_to_int < y2_to_int, for all y1, y2 in years.

-   Gabe Grant began 1 year after Wonderman:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the years for Gabe Grant and Wonderman, such that Gabe Grant's starting year is 1 more than Wonderman's starting year. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    y1 == GabeGrant and y2 == Wonderman => y1_to_int == y2_to_int + 1, for all y1, y2 in years.

-   The four people are Deep Shadow, the superhero who started in 2007, the hero who started in 2009, and Matt Minkle:
    This is a constraint that states that all these entities are different, thus:
    AllDifferent([DeepShadow, 2007, 2009, MattMinkle]).
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if GabeGrant == 1, and 2007 == 1, and DeepShadow == 1, then Gabe Grant is Ultra Hex, started in 2007, and is Deep Shadow.

    This is a constraint that states that Criminal Bane's starting year is either 2007 or 2009, but not both. So:
    Xor([CriminalBane == 2007, CriminalBane == 2009]).

    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the years for Peter Powers and Matt Minkle, such that Peter Powers' starting year is less than Matt Minkle's starting year. So, the constraints will be of the form:

The Sancode interview is 1 day after the meeting for the copywriter position.
The Laneplex interview is on August 20th.
The meeting for the copywriter position is 2 days before the meeting for the web developer position.

companies: Canway, Haytouch, Laneplex, Sancode
positions: copywriter, janitor, sales rep, web developer
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Sancode == 1, and August21st == 1, and copywriter == 1, then the Sancode interview is on August 21st for the copywriter position.

### Constraints:
-   The Sancode interview is 1 day after the meeting for the copywriter position:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the dates for the Sancode interview and the meeting for the copywriter position, such that the Sancode interview date is 1 more than the copywriter meeting date. So, the constraints will be of the form:

    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the dates for the copywriter meeting and the web developer meeting, such that the copywriter meeting date is 2 less than the web developer meeting date. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    d1 == copywriter and d2 == web developer => d1_to_int == d2_to_int - 2, for all d1, d2 in dates.

Clues:
Of Sophie and Gwen, one will bring their rabbit's foot and the other will leave in January.
Sophie will leave sometime before Gwen.
The passenger with the lucky hat, Gwen and Sophie are all different fliers.
Florence will leave 2 months after the passenger with the lucky hat.
The passenger leaving in April is either Gwen or the passenger with the talisman.

Entities:
months: January, February, March, April
fliers: Florence, Gwen, Olive, Sophie
lucky charms: coin, lucky hat, rabbit's foot, talisman
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Florence == 1, and April == 1, and Talisman == 1, then Florence will leave in April with the talisman.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the fliers: Florence, Gwen, Olive, Sophie (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Months of departure: January, February, March, April (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Lucky charms: Coin, LuckyHat, RabbitFoot, Talisman (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   Of Sophie and Gwen, one will bring their rabbit's foot and the other will leave in January:
    This is a constraint that states that Sophie and Gwen are different and one will bring the rabbit's foot while the other will leave in January. So:
    (Sophie == RabbitFoot and Gwen == January) or (Gwen == RabbitFoot and Sophie == January).

-   Sophie will leave sometime before Gwen:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months of departure for Sophie and Gwen, such that Sophie's month of departure is less than Gwen's month of departure. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == Sophie and m2 == Gwen => m1_to_int < m2_to_int, for all m1, m2 in months of departure.

-   The passenger with the lucky hat, Gwen, and Sophie are all different fliers:
    This is a constraint that states that all these entities are different, thus:
    AllDifferent([LuckyHat, Gwen, Sophie]).

-   Florence will leave 2 months after the passenger with the lucky hat:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months of departure for Florence and the passenger with the lucky hat, such that Florence's month of departure is 2 more than the lucky hat passenger's month of departure. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == Florence and m2 == LuckyHat => m1_to_int == m2_to_int + 2, for all m1, m2 in months of departure.

-   The passenger leaving in April is either Gwen or the passenger with the talisman:
    This is a constraint that states that the passenger leaving in April is either Gwen or the passenger with the talisman, but not both. So:
    Xor([Gwen == April, Talisman == April]).
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Florence == 1, and April == 1, and Talisman == 1, then Florence will leave in April with the talisman.

### Constraints:
-   Of Sophie and Gwen, one will bring their rabbit's foot and the other will leave in January:
    This is a constraint that states that Sophie and Gwen are different and one will bring the rabbit's foot while the other will leave in January. So:
    (Sophie == RabbitFoot and Gwen == January) or (Gwen == RabbitFoot and Sophie == January).

-   Sophie will leave sometime before Gwen:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months of departure for Sophie and Gwen, such that Sophie's month of departure is less than Gwen's month of departure. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == Sophie and m2 == Gwen => m1_to_int < m2_to_int, for all m1, m2 in months of departure.

-   The passenger with the lucky hat, Gwen, and Sophie are all different fliers:
    This is a constraint that states that all these entities are different, thus:
    AllDifferent([LuckyHat, Gwen, Sophie]).

-   Florence will leave 2 months after the passenger with the lucky hat:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months of departure for Florence and the passenger with the lucky hat, such that Florence's month of departure is 2 more than the lucky hat passenger's month of departure. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == Florence and m2 == LuckyHat => m1_to_int == m2_to_int + 2, for all m1, m2 in months of departure.

-   The passenger leaving in April is either Gwen or the passenger with the talisman:
    This is a constraint that states that the passenger leaving in April is either Gwen or the passenger with the talisman, but not both. So:
    Xor([Gwen == April, Talisman == April]).

The Iunsel launched in February.
The Munei is going to Mars.
The Munei launched 1 month after the mission going to Pluto.
Of the mission going to Ganymede and the mission going to Pluto, one launched in March and the other is the Chano.

Entities:
months: January, February, March, April
probes: Ateyin, Chano, Iunsel, Munei
destinations: Ganymede, Mars, Pluto, Uranus
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Ateyin == 1, and January == 1, and Ganymede == 1, then Ateyin's mission to Ganymede was launched in January.

### Decision variables:

### Constraints:
-   The Iunsel launched in February:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Iunsel == February.

-   The Munei is going to Mars:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Munei == Mars.

-   The Munei launched 1 month after the mission going to Pluto:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months of launch for the Munei and the mission going to Pluto, such that Munei's launch month is 1 more than the Pluto mission's launch month. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == Munei and m2 == Pluto => m1_to_int == m2_to_int + 1, for all m1, m2 in months of launch.

-   Of the mission going to Ganymede and the mission going to Pluto, one launched in March and the other is the Chano:
    This is a constraint that states that one mission went to Ganymede and the other to Pluto, one launched in March, and the other is the Chano. So:
    (Ganymede == March and Pluto == Chano) or (Ganymede == Chano and Pluto == March).

Clues:
The blue topaz sold for 10 dollars more than the gem found in the Osborne claim.
The rhodolite went for $820.
The tourmaline is either the gem that sold for $810 or the gem found in the Underwood claim.
Of the gem found in the Collins claim and the aquamarine, one went for $790 and the other went for $800.

Entities:
prices: $790, $800, $810, $820
gems: aquamarine, blue topaz, rhodolite, tourmaline
claims: Collins, Knox, Osborne, Underwood
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Aquamarine == 1, and Collins == 1, and Price790 == 1, then the aquamarine found in the Collins claim went for $790.

-   Names of the gems: Aquamarine, BlueTopaz, Rhodolite, Tourmaline (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Claims where the gems were found: Collins, Knox, Osborne, Underwood (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The blue topaz sold for 10 dollars more than the gem found in the Osborne claim:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of prices for the blue topaz and the gem found in the Osborne claim, such that the blue topaz's price is 10 dollars more than the Osborne claim gem's price. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == BlueTopaz and p2 == Osborne => p1_to_int == p2_to_int + 10, for all p1, p2 in prices.

-   The rhodolite went for $820:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Rhodolite == Price820.

-   The tourmaline is either the gem that sold for $810 or the gem found in the Underwood claim:
    This is a constraint that states that the tourmaline's price is either $810 or the gem found in the Underwood claim, but not both. So:
    Xor([Tourmaline == Price810, Tourmaline == Underwood]).

-   Of the gem found in the Collins claim and the aquamarine, one went for $790 and the other went for $800:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of prices for the gem found in the Collins claim and the aquamarine, such that one gem's price is $790 and the other gem's price is $800. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    (c == Collins and a == Aquamarine and c_to_int == Price790 and a_to_int == Price800) or (c == Aquamarine and a == Collins and c_to_int == Price800 and a_to_int == Price790), for all c, a in claims.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Aquamarine == 1, and Collins == 1, and Price790 == 1, then the aquamarine found in the Collins claim went for $790.

-   The rhodolite went for $820:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Rhodolite == Price820.

-   The tourmaline is either the gem that sold for $810 or the gem found in the Underwood claim:
    This is a constraint that states that the tourmaline's price is either $810 or the gem found in the Underwood claim, but not both. So:

-   Of the gem found in the Collins claim and the aquamarine, one went for $790 and the other went for $800:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of prices for the gem found in the Collins claim and the aquamarine, such that one gem's price is $790 and the other gem's price is $800. So, the constraints will be of the form:

Clues:
The facility launching in March is the tokamak reactor.
The reactor launching in April is either the direct drive facility or the z-pinch facility.
Of the fusor reactor and the z-pinch facility, one will launch in February and the other is the Kuchiwa W10.
The Essita CBT will launch in February.
The Haramarui LV will launch 1 month before the fusor reactor.

Entities:
months: January, February, March, April
names: Essita CBT, Haramarui LV, Kuchiwa W10, Rodim-Rexit
types: direct drive, fusor, tokamak, z-pinch
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if EssitaCBT == 1, and February == 1, and Tokamak == 1, then Essita CBT is the tokamak reactor launching in February.

### Decision variables:

### Constraints:
-   The facility launching in March is the tokamak reactor:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    March == Tokamak.

-   The reactor launching in April is either the direct drive facility or the z-pinch facility:
    This is a constraint that states that the reactor launching in April is either the direct drive facility or the z-pinch facility, but not both. So:
    Xor([April == DirectDrive, April == ZPinch]).

-   Of the fusor reactor and the z-pinch facility, one will launch in February and the other is the Kuchiwa W10:
    This is a constraint that states that one of the fusor reactor and the z-pinch facility will launch in February and the other is the Kuchiwa W10. So:
    (Fusor == February and ZPinch == KuchiwaW10) or (Fusor == KuchiwaW10 and ZPinch == February).

-   The Essita CBT will launch in February:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    EssitaCBT == February.

-   The Haramarui LV will launch 1 month before the fusor reactor:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months of launch for Haramarui LV and the fusor reactor, such that Haramarui LV's launch month is 1 less than the fusor reactor's launch month. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == HaramaruiLV and m2 == Fusor => m1_to_int == m2_to_int - 1, for all m1, m2 in months of launch.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if EssitaCBT == 1, and February == 1, and Tokamak == 1, then Essita CBT is the tokamak reactor launching in February.

    Xor([April == DirectDrive, April == ZPinch]).

-   Of the fusor reactor and the z-pinch facility, one will launch in February and the other is the Kuchiwa W10:
    This is a constraint that states that one of the fusor reactor and the z-pinch facility will launch in February and the other is the Kuchiwa W10. So:
    (Fusor == February and ZPinch == KuchiwaW10) or (Fusor == KuchiwaW10 and ZPinch == February).

-   The Essita CBT will launch in February:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    EssitaCBT == February.

-   The Haramarui LV will launch 1 month before the fusor reactor:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months of launch for Haramarui LV and the fusor reactor, such that Haramarui LV's launch month is 1 less than the fusor reactor's launch month. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == HaramaruiLV and m2 == Fusor => m1_to_int == m2_to_int - 1, for all m1, m2 in months of launch.

Of the anniversary event and the event with 100 attendees, one will be handled by Joel and the other will be handled by Susan.
Herbert's assignment will involve 25 fewer people than Susan's assignment.
Of the assignment with 75 attendees and the assignment with 100 attendees, one will be handled by Susan and the other is the birthday.
Herbert's event is either the event with 50 attendees or the graduation job.

Entities:
people: 50, 75, 100, 125
planners: Herbert, Joel, Susan, Teresa
events: anniversary, birthday, graduation, wedding
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if 50 == 1, and Herbert == 1, and anniversary == 1, then the event with 50 attendees handled by Herbert is the anniversary event.

### Decision variables:

    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the number of people attending Herbert's assignment and Susan's assignment, such that Herbert's assignment involves 25 fewer people than Susan's assignment. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Herbert and p2 == Susan => p1_to_int == p2_to_int - 25, for all p1, p2 in number of people.

-   Of the assignment with 75 attendees and the assignment with 100 attendees, one will be handled by Susan and the other is the birthday:
    This is a constraint that states that the assignment with 75 attendees and the assignment with 100 attendees will be handled by Susan and the birthday event, but not both. So:
    Xor([75 == Susan, 75 == birthday], [100 == Susan, 100 == birthday]).

-   Herbert's event is either the event with 50 attendees or the graduation job:
    This is a constraint that states that Herbert's event is either the event with 50 attendees or the graduation event, but not both. So:

D. forcilitis has 500 genes.
B. mangeris was either the one sequenced by Dr. Ortiz or the organism with 750 genes.
The organism sequenced by Dr. Trujillo has 500 more genes than the bacteria sequenced by Dr. Nielsen.
Of the bacteria sequenced by Dr. Jordan and the bacteria sequenced by Dr. Trujillo, one has 1000 genes and the other is E. carolinus.

Entities:
genes: 250, 500, 750, 1000
bacteria: B. mangeris, D. forcilitis, E. carolinus, P. wellington
doctors: Jordan, Nielsen, Ortiz, Trujillo
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Bmangeris == 1, and DrOrtiz == 1, and Genes750 == 1, then B. mangeris was sequenced by Dr. Ortiz and has 750 genes.

### Decision variables:

-   B. mangeris was either the one sequenced by Dr. Ortiz or the organism with 750 genes:
    This is a constraint that states that B. mangeris was either sequenced by Dr. Ortiz or has 750 genes, but not both. So:

-   The organism sequenced by Dr. Trujillo has 500 more genes than the bacteria sequenced by Dr. Nielsen:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the number of genes for the organism sequenced by Dr. Trujillo and the bacteria sequenced by Dr. Nielsen, such that the organism sequenced by Dr. Trujillo has 500 more genes than the bacteria sequenced by Dr. Nielsen. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    g1 == Trujillo and g2 == Nielsen => g1_to_int == g2_to_int + 500, for all g1, g2 in number of genes.

-   Of the bacteria sequenced by Dr. Jordan and the bacteria sequenced by Dr. Trujillo, one has 1000 genes and the other is E. carolinus:
    This is a constraint that states that one of the bacteria sequenced by Dr. Jordan and Dr. Trujillo has 1000 genes and the other is E. carolinus. So:
    (Jordan == Genes1000 and Trujillo == Ecarolinus) or (Jordan == Ecarolinus and Trujillo == Genes1000).
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Bmangeris == 1, and DrOrtiz == 1, and Genes750 == 1, then B. mangeris was sequenced by Dr. Ortiz and has 750 genes.

    This is a constraint that states that one of Mt. Brewer or Mt. Quinn is climbed by Ben Beasley and the other is 470 feet tall. So:
    (MtBrewer == BenBeasley and MtQuinn == Height470) or (MtQuinn == BenBeasley and MtBrewer == Height470).

-   Mt. Brewer is either the mountain summited by Leonard Lara or the peak that is 600 feet tall:

Clues:
Opie Oliver's card came out in 2012.
The piece that sold for $175 came out in 1999.
Of the 2012 card and the 1987 item, one featured Mike Morales and the other sold for $275.
Neddy Norris's item sold for 50 dollars more than the 1987 card.

Entities:
prices: $125, $175, $225, $275
players: Finn Freeman, Mike Morales, Neddy Norris, Opie Oliver
years: 1974, 1987, 1999, 2012
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if OpieOliver == 1, and Year2012 == 1, and Price125 == 1, then Opie Oliver's card came out in 2012 and sold for $125.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the players: FinnFreeman, MikeMorales, NeddyNorris, OpieOliver (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Years of the items: Year1974, Year1987, Year1999, Year2012 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Prices of the items: Price125, Price175, Price225, Price275 (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   Opie Oliver's card came out in 2012:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    OpieOliver == Year2012.

-   The piece that sold for $175 came out in 1999:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Price175 == Year1999.

-   Of the 2012 card and the 1987 item, one featured Mike Morales and the other sold for $275:
    This is a constraint that states that one of the items from 2012 and 1987 is associated with Mike Morales and the other sold for $275. So, we can represent this as:
    (Year2012 == MikeMorales and Price275 == Year1987) or (Year2012 == Price275 and MikeMorales == Year1987).

-   Neddy Norris's item sold for 50 dollars more than the 1987 card:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the prices for Neddy Norris's item and the 1987 card, such that Neddy Norris's item price is $50 more than the 1987 card's price. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == NeddyNorris and p2 == Year1987 => p1_to_int == p2_to_int + 50, for all p1, p2 in prices.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if OpieOliver == 1, and Year2012 == 1, and Price125 == 1, then Opie Oliver's card came out in 2012 and sold for $125.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the players: FinnFreeman, MikeMorales, NeddyNorris, OpieOliver (all different, 1 to 4)

    This is a constraint that states that one of the items from 2012 and 1987 is associated with Mike Morales and the other sold for $275. So, we can represent this as:
    (Year2012 == MikeMorales and Price275 == Year1987) or (Year2012 == Price275 and MikeMorales == Year1987).

-   Neddy Norris's item sold for 50 dollars more than the 1987 card:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the prices for Neddy Norris's item and the 1987 card, such that Neddy Norris's item price is $50 more than the 1987 card's price. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == NeddyNorris and p2 == Year1987 => p1_to_int == p2_to_int + 50, for all p1, p2 in prices.

Clues:
Of Nelson and the cook who scored 63 points, one made the lemon snapper and the other made the cajun chili.
Of the chef who scored 42 points and the cook who scored 63 points, one made the cashew tofu and the other was Rosalie.
Karl scored 7 more points than the person who made the lemon snapper.

Entities:
scores: 42, 49, 56, 63
chefs: Karl, Nelson, Peggy, Rosalie
dishes: cajun chili, cashew tofu, lemon snapper, smoked pork
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Karl == 1, and 42 == 1, and CajunChili == 1, then Karl scored 42 points and made the cajun chili.

### Decision variables:
-   Scores: 42, 49, 56, 63 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Chefs: Karl, Nelson, Peggy, Rosalie (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Dishes: CajunChili, CashewTofu, LemonSnapper, SmokedPork (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   Of Nelson and the cook who scored 63 points, one made the lemon snapper and the other made the cajun chili:
    This is a constraint that states that one of Nelson or the cook who scored 63 points made the lemon snapper and the other made the cajun chili. So, we need to add constraints to ensure this:
    (Nelson == LemonSnapper and Cook63 == CajunChili) or (Nelson == CajunChili and Cook63 == LemonSnapper).

-   Of the chef who scored 42 points and the cook who scored 63 points, one made the cashew tofu and the other was Rosalie:
    This is a constraint that states that one of the chef who scored 42 points made the cashew tofu and the other was Rosalie. So, we need to add constraints to ensure this:
    (Chef42 == CashewTofu and Rosalie == Cook63) or (Chef42 == Rosalie and Cook63 == CashewTofu).

-   Karl scored 7 more points than the person who made the lemon snapper:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of scores for Karl and the person who made the lemon snapper, such that Karl's score is 7 more than the other person's score. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    s1 == Karl and s2 == LemonSnapper => s1_to_int == s2_to_int + 7, for all s1, s2 in scores.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Karl == 1, and 42 == 1, and CajunChili == 1, then Karl scored 42 points and made the cajun chili.

### Decision variables:
-   Scores: 42, 49, 56, 63 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Chefs: Karl, Nelson, Peggy, Rosalie (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Dishes: CajunChili, CashewTofu, LemonSnapper, SmokedPork (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:

    This is a constraint that states that one of the chef who scored 42 points made the cashew tofu and the other was Rosalie. So, we need to add constraints to ensure this:
    (Chef42 == CashewTofu and Rosalie == Cook63) or (Chef42 == Rosalie and Cook63 == CashewTofu).

-   Karl scored 7 more points than the person who made the lemon snapper:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of scores for Karl and the person who made the lemon snapper, such that Karl's score is 7 more than the other person's score. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    s1 == Karl and s2 == LemonSnapper => s1_to_int == s2_to_int + 7, for all s1, s2 in scores.

Alejandro's purchase cost less than Irma's purchase.
The insect that sold for $90 was either the atlas butterfly or the emperor butterfly.
The peacock butterfly cost more than Irma's purchase.
Of Alejandro's purchase and Irma's purchase, one was the emperor butterfly and the other sold for $45.
The four butterflies were Phillip's purchase, the insect that sold for $60, the butterfly that sold for $45 and the butterfly that sold for $90.

Entities:
prices: $45, $60, $75, $90
winners: Alejandro, Faye, Irma, Phillip
butterflies: atlas, emperor, grayling, peacock
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Alejandro == 1, and Price45 == 1, and Atlas == 1, then Alejandro's purchase was the atlas butterfly that sold for $45.

### Decision variables:

-   Prices of the purchases: Price45, Price60, Price75, Price90 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Types of butterflies: Atlas, Emperor, Grayling, Peacock (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   Alejandro's purchase cost less than Irma's purchase:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of prices for Alejandro and Irma's purchases, such that Alejandro's purchase price is less than Irma's purchase price. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Alejandro and p2 == Irma => p1_to_int < p2_to_int, for all p1, p2 in prices.

-   The insect that sold for $90 was either the atlas butterfly or the emperor butterfly:
    This is a constraint that states that the butterfly that sold for $90 is either the atlas butterfly or the emperor butterfly, but not both. So:
    Xor([Atlas == Price90, Emperor == Price90]).

-   The peacock butterfly cost more than Irma's purchase:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of prices for the peacock butterfly and Irma's purchase, such that the peacock butterfly's price is greater than Irma's purchase price. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Peacock and p2 == Irma => p1_to_int > p2_to_int, for all p1, p2 in prices.

-   Of Alejandro's purchase and Irma's purchase, one was the emperor butterfly and the other sold for $45:
    This is a constraint that states that one of Alejandro's purchase and Irma's purchase was the emperor butterfly and the other sold for $45. So:
    (Alejandro == Emperor and Irma == Price45) or (Alejandro == Price45 and Irma == Emperor).

-   The four butterflies were Phillip's purchase, the insect that sold for $60, the butterfly that sold for $45, and the butterfly that sold for $90:
    This is a constraint that states that each butterfly corresponds to one of the given prices. So, we will have direct assignment constraints for each butterfly and price combination.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Alejandro == 1, and Price45 == 1, and Atlas == 1, then Alejandro's purchase was the atlas butterfly that sold for $45.

-   The insect that sold for $90 was either the atlas butterfly or the emperor butterfly:
    This is a constraint that states that the butterfly that sold for $90 is either the atlas butterfly or the emperor butterfly, but not both. So:
    Xor([Atlas == Price90, Emperor == Price90]).

-   The peacock butterfly cost more than Irma's purchase:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of prices for the peacock butterfly and Irma's purchase, such that the peacock butterfly's price is greater than Irma's purchase price. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Peacock and p2 == Irma => p1_to_int > p2_to_int, for all p1, p2 in prices.

-   Of Alejandro's purchase and Irma's purchase, one was the emperor butterfly and the other sold for $45:
    This is a constraint that states that one of Alejandro's purchase and Irma's purchase was the emperor butterfly and the other sold for $45. So:
    (Alejandro == Emperor and Irma == Price45) or (Alejandro == Price45 and Irma == Emperor).

-   The four butterflies were Phillip's purchase, the insect that sold for $60, the butterfly that sold for $45, and the butterfly that sold for $90:

### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Antonio == 1, and 184Days == 1, and BodegaBay == 1, then Antonio traveled for 184 days starting from Bodega Bay.

    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    195Days == Pescadero.

-   Of Dana and the athlete who traveled for 184 days, one started from Cayucos and the other started from Bodega Bay:
    This is a constraint that states that Dana and the athlete who traveled for 184 days started from different places, Cayucos and Bodega Bay. So:
    Xor([Dana == Cayucos, Dana == BodegaBay]).

-   Hilda finished in 217 days:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Hilda == 217Days.

-   Walter finished 11 days before the athlete who started from Cayucos:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the durations for Walter and the athlete who started from Cayucos, such that Walter's duration is 11 less than the Cayucos athlete's duration. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    d1 == Walter and d2 == Cayucos => d1_to_int == d2_to_int - 11, for all d1, d2 in durations.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet.

    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    195Days == Pescadero.

-   Of Dana and the athlete who traveled for 184 days, one started from Cayucos and the other started from Bodega Bay:
    This is a constraint that states that Dana and the athlete who traveled for 184 days started from different places, Cayucos and Bodega Bay. So:
    Xor([Dana == Cayucos, Dana == BodegaBay]).

-   Hilda finished in 217 days:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Hilda == 217Days.

Entities:
earnings: 2 million, 5 million, 8 million, 11 million
movies: Amerigo, Fast and Dead, Let Me Out, What a World
directors: Jim Johnson, Kenneth Key, Linda Lynch, Micah Moreno
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Amerigo == 1, and 2Million == 1, and JimJohnson == 1, then Amerigo made 2 million and was directed by Jim Johnson.

### Constraints:
-   The movie that grossed 5 million was directed by Kenneth Key:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    5Million == KennethKey.

-   Of What a World and Amerigo, one made 2 million and the other was directed by Jim Johnson:
    This is a constraint that states that one of the movies made 2 million and was directed by Jim Johnson, and the other movie was not. So:
    Xor([WhatAWorld == 2Million and Amerigo == JimJohnson, WhatAWorld == JimJohnson and Amerigo == 2Million]).

-   The film directed by Kenneth Key made 3 million less than Amerigo:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of earnings for the movie directed by Kenneth Key and Amerigo, such that Kenneth Key's movie's earnings is 3 less than Amerigo's earnings. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    e1 == KennethKey and e2 == Amerigo => e1_to_int == e2_to_int - 3, for all e1, e2 in earnings.

-   Fast and Dead was directed by Kenneth Key:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    FastAndDead == KennethKey.

-   Let Me Out is either the movie directed by Linda Lynch or the movie that grossed 5 million:
    This is a constraint that states that Let Me Out is either directed by Linda Lynch or made 5 million, but not both. So:

### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Amerigo == 1, and 2Million == 1, and JimJohnson == 1, then Amerigo made 2 million and was directed by Jim Johnson.

    This is a constraint that states that one of the movies made 2 million and was directed by Jim Johnson, and the other movie was not. So:
    Xor([WhatAWorld == 2Million and Amerigo == JimJohnson, WhatAWorld == JimJohnson and Amerigo == 2Million]).

-   The film directed by Kenneth Key made 3 million less than Amerigo:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of earnings for the movie directed by Kenneth Key and Amerigo, such that Kenneth Key's movie's earnings is 3 less than Amerigo's earnings. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    e1 == KennethKey and e2 == Amerigo => e1_to_int == e2_to_int - 3, for all e1, e2 in earnings.

-   Fast and Dead was directed by Kenneth Key:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    FastAndDead == KennethKey.

-   Let Me Out is either the movie directed by Linda Lynch or the movie that grossed 5 million:
    This is a constraint that states that Let Me Out is either directed by Linda Lynch or made 5 million, but not both. So:
    Xor([LetMeOut == LindaLynch, LetMeOut == 5Million]).

Clues:
The person who is 110 years old is a native of Connecticut.
Of Arlene and the Texas native, one is 110 years old and the other is 109 years old.
Herbert is 1 year younger than Doris.
The person who is 112 years old is either Herbert or the New Mexico native.

Entities:
ages: 109 years, 110 years, 111 years, 112 years
names: Arlene, Doris, Floyd, Herbert
states: Connecticut, Missouri, New Mexico, Texas
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Arlene == 1, and 109years == 1, and Connecticut == 1, then Arlene is 109 years old and is a native of Connecticut.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the individuals: Arlene, Doris, Floyd, Herbert (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Ages of the individuals: 109 years, 110 years, 111 years, 112 years (all different, 1 to 4)
-   States of origin: Connecticut, Missouri, New Mexico, Texas (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The person who is 110 years old is a native of Connecticut:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    110years == Connecticut.

-   Of Arlene and the Texas native, one is 110 years old and the other is 109 years old:
    This is a constraint that states that one of Arlene and the Texas native is 110 years old and the other is 109 years old. So, we can represent this as:
    (Arlene == 110years and Texas == 109years) or (Arlene == 109years and Texas == 110years).

-   Herbert is 1 year younger than Doris:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of ages for Herbert and Doris, such that Herbert's age is 1 less than Doris's age. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    a1 == Herbert and a2 == Doris => a1_to_int == a2_to_int - 1, for all a1, a2 in ages.

-   The person who is 112 years old is either Herbert or the New Mexico native:
    This is a constraint that states that the person who is 112 years old is either Herbert or the New Mexico native, but not both. So:

Clues:
Snappy is 18 years younger than the swoopbacked tortoise.
The 68 year old animal is the horned tortoise.
Chewie is 32 years old.
Of Snappy and Toredo, one is 14 years old and the other is the horned tortoise.
The pitch belly tortoise is younger than Chewie.

Entities:
ages: 14, 32, 50, 68
tortoises: Chewie, Snappy, Speedy, Toredo
species: black neck, horned, pitch belly, swoopbacked
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Chewie == 1, and Age32 == 1, and Horned == 1, then Chewie is 32 years old and is a horned tortoise.

### Decision variables:

-   Names of the tortoises: Chewie, Snappy, Speedy, Toredo (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Species of the tortoises: BlackNeck, Horned, PitchBelly, Swoopbacked (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   Snappy is 18 years younger than the swoopbacked tortoise:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of ages for Snappy and the swoopbacked tortoise, such that Snappy's age is 18 less than the swoopbacked tortoise's age. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    a1 == Snappy and a2 == Swoopbacked => a1_to_int == a2_to_int - 18, for all a1, a2 in ages.

-   The 68-year-old animal is the horned tortoise:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Age68 == Horned.

-   Chewie is 32 years old:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Age32 == Chewie.

-   Of Snappy and Toredo, one is 14 years old and the other is the horned tortoise:
    This is a constraint that states that one of Snappy or Toredo is 14 years old and the other is the horned tortoise. So, we can represent this as:
    (Snappy == Age14 and Toredo == Horned) or (Snappy == Horned and Toredo == Age14).

-   The pitch belly tortoise is younger than Chewie:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of ages for the pitch belly tortoise and Chewie, such that the pitch belly tortoise's age is less than Chewie's age. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    a1 == PitchBelly and a2 == Chewie => a1_to_int < a2_to_int, for all a1, a2 in ages.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Chewie == 1, and Age32 == 1, and Horned == 1, then Chewie is 32 years old and is a horned tortoise.

### Constraints:
-   Snappy is 18 years younger than the swoopbacked tortoise:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of ages for Snappy and the swoopbacked tortoise, such that Snappy's age is 18 less than the swoopbacked tortoise's age. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    a1 == Snappy and a2 == Swoopbacked => a1_to_int == a2_to_int - 18, for all a1, a2 in ages.

-   The 68-year-old animal is the horned tortoise:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Age68 == Horned.

-   Chewie is 32 years old:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Age32 == Chewie.

-   Of Snappy and Toredo, one is 14 years old and the other is the horned tortoise:
    This is a constraint that states that one of Snappy or Toredo is 14 years old and the other is the horned tortoise. So, we can represent this as:
    (Snappy == Age14 and Toredo == Horned) or (Snappy == Horned and Toredo == Age14).

-   The pitch belly tortoise is younger than Chewie:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of ages for the pitch belly tortoise and Chewie, such that the pitch belly tortoise's age is less than Chewie's age. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    a1 == PitchBelly and a2 == Chewie => a1_to_int < a2_to_int, for all a1, a2 in ages.
```python
from cpmpy import *

# Decision variables
# (variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet of age, tortoise, and species)

Clues:
Of the parrot and the lorikeet, one was bought in April and the other is Roberta's.
Natalie's pet was bought sometime before Roberta's pet.
Laura's pet is the lovebird.
The bird bought in February is either the lorikeet or the lovebird.
Of the bird bought in February and the macaw, one is Natalie's and the other is Roberta's.

Entities:
months: January, February, March, April
names: Celia, Laura, Natalie, Roberta
birds: lorikeet, lovebird, macaw, parrot
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Celia == 1, and January == 1, and Lorikeet == 1, then Celia bought a lorikeet in January.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the owners: Celia, Laura, Natalie, Roberta (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Months of purchase: January, February, March, April (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Types of birds: Lorikeet, Lovebird, Macaw, Parrot (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   Of the parrot and the lorikeet, one was bought in April and the other is Roberta's:
    This is a constraint that states that one of the parrot or the lorikeet was bought in April and the other is Roberta's. So, we can represent this as:
    (Parrot == April and Lorikeet == Roberta) or (Lorikeet == April and Parrot == Roberta).

-   Natalie's pet was bought sometime before Roberta's pet:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months of purchase for Natalie and Roberta's pets, such that Natalie's pet's month of purchase is less than Roberta's pet's month of purchase. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == Natalie and m2 == Roberta => m1_to_int < m2_to_int, for all m1, m2 in months of purchase.

-   Laura's pet is the lovebird:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Laura == Lovebird.

-   The bird bought in February is either the lorikeet or the lovebird:
    This is a constraint that states that the bird bought in February is either the lorikeet or the lovebird, but not both. So:
    Xor([February == Lorikeet, February == Lovebird]).

-   Of the bird bought in February and the macaw, one is Natalie's and the other is Roberta's:
    This is a constraint that states that the bird bought in February and the macaw are owned by Natalie and Roberta, but not in the same combination. So:
    Xor([February == Natalie and Macaw == Roberta, February == Roberta and Macaw == Natalie]).
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Celia == 1, and January == 1, and Lorikeet == 1, then Celia bought a lorikeet in January.

    (Parrot == April and Lorikeet == Roberta) or (Lorikeet == April and Parrot == Roberta).

-   Natalie's pet was bought sometime before Roberta's pet:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months of purchase for Natalie and Roberta's pets, such that Natalie's pet's month of purchase is less than Roberta's pet's month of purchase. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == Natalie and m2 == Roberta => m1_to_int < m2_to_int, for all m1, m2 in months of purchase.

-   Laura's pet is the lovebird:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Laura == Lovebird.

-   The bird bought in February is either the lorikeet or the lovebird:
    This is a constraint that states that the bird bought in February is either the lorikeet or the lovebird, but not both. So:

    p1 == Hannah and p2 == Nancy => p1_to_int == p2_to_int - 10, for all p1, p2 in prices.

-   Nancy's client, Hannah, and Ginger were all different clients:
    This is a constraint that states that all these entities are different, thus:
    AllDifferent([Nancy, Hannah, Ginger]).

-   Hannah was either the person who paid $180 or Lynda's client:
    This is a constraint that states that Hannah is either the person who paid $180 or Lynda's client, but not both. Thus:
    Xor([Hannah == Price180, Hannah == Lynda]).

Clues:
The 115 ft tall waterfall is either the waterfall in Nigeria or the waterfall located in Tibet.
Inawatai is 100 ft tall.
Nyalt is 10 ft taller than Rhoqua.
The waterfall in Brazil is somewhat shorter than Rhoqua.
The waterfall in Brazil is 10 ft shorter than the waterfall located in Nigeria.

Entities:
waterfalls: Sihat, Rhoqua, Nyalt, Inawatai
heights: 100 ft, 105 ft, 110 ft, 115 ft
countries: Brazil, Nigeria, Tibet, Switzerland
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Sihat == 1, and 100ft == 1, and Brazil == 1, then Sihat is the 100 ft tall waterfall located in Brazil.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the waterfalls: Sihat, Rhoqua, Nyalt, Inawatai (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Heights of the waterfalls: 100 ft, 105 ft, 110 ft, 115 ft (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Countries where the waterfalls are located: Brazil, Nigeria, Tibet, Switzerland (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The 115 ft tall waterfall is either the waterfall in Nigeria or the waterfall located in Tibet:
    This is a constraint that states that the 115 ft tall waterfall is either in Nigeria or Tibet, but not both. So:
    Xor([115ft == Nigeria, 115ft == Tibet]).

-   Inawatai is 100 ft tall:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Inawatai == 100ft.

-   Nyalt is 10 ft taller than Rhoqua:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of heights for Nyalt and Rhoqua, such that Nyalt's height is 10 ft more than Rhoqua's height. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    h1 == Nyalt and h2 == Rhoqua => h1_to_int == h2_to_int + 10, for all h1, h2 in heights.

-   The waterfall in Brazil is somewhat shorter than Rhoqua:
    This is a constraint that states that the waterfall in Brazil is shorter than Rhoqua. So:
    Brazil < Rhoqua.

-   The waterfall in Brazil is 10 ft shorter than the waterfall located in Nigeria:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of heights for the waterfalls in Brazil and Nigeria, such that the waterfall in Brazil is 10 ft shorter than the waterfall in Nigeria. So, the constraints will be of the form:

-   Inawatai is 100 ft tall:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Inawatai == 100ft.

-   Nyalt is 10 ft taller than Rhoqua:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of heights for Nyalt and Rhoqua, such that Nyalt's height is 10 ft more than Rhoqua's height. So, the constraints will be of the form:

    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of goals for Parrish and Quinn, such that Parrish's goals are 1 more than Quinn's goals. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    g1 == Parrish and g2 == Quinn => g1_to_int == g2_to_int + 1, for all g1, g2 in goals.

Clues:
Jorge is either the skydiver who wears the red suit or the jumper who started in 1982.
The skydiver who wears the pink suit started skydiving 1 year before Otis.
The jumper who wears the yellow suit started skydiving sometime after Philip.
The jumper who wears the lime green suit started skydiving sometime after the jumper who wears the yellow suit.
The jumper who wears the pink suit started skydiving 2 years before Shaun.

Entities:
names: Jorge, Otis, Philip, Shaun
years: 1982, 1983, 1984, 1985
suit colors: lime green, pink, red, yellow
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Jorge == 1, and LimeGreen == 1, and 1982 == 1, then Jorge is the skydiver who wears the lime green suit and started skydiving in 1982.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the skydivers: Jorge, Otis, Philip, Shaun (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Starting years of skydiving: 1982, 1983, 1984, 1985 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Suit colors: LimeGreen, Pink, Red, Yellow (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   Jorge is either the skydiver who wears the red suit or the jumper who started in 1982:
    This is a constraint that states that Jorge's suit color is either red or Jorge started skydiving in 1982, but not both. So:
    Xor([Jorge == Red, Jorge == 1982]).

-   The skydiver who wears the pink suit started skydiving 1 year before Otis:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the starting years for the skydiver who wears the pink suit and Otis, such that the skydiver who wears the pink suit's starting year is 1 less than Otis's starting year. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    y1 == Pink and y2 == Otis => y1_to_int == y2_to_int - 1, for all y1, y2 in starting years.

-   The jumper who wears the yellow suit started skydiving sometime after Philip:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the starting years for the jumper who wears the yellow suit and Philip, such that the jumper who wears the yellow suit's starting year is greater than Philip's starting year. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    y1 == Yellow and y2 == Philip => y1_to_int > y2_to_int, for all y1, y2 in starting years.

-   The jumper who wears the lime green suit started skydiving sometime after the jumper who wears the yellow suit:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the starting years for the jumper who wears the lime green suit and the jumper who wears the yellow suit, such that the jumper who wears the lime green suit's starting year is greater than the jumper who wears the yellow suit's starting year. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    y1 == LimeGreen and y2 == Yellow => y1_to_int > y2_to_int, for all y1, y2 in starting years.

-   The jumper who wears the pink suit started skydiving 2 years before Shaun:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the starting years for the jumper who wears the pink suit and Shaun, such that the jumper who wears the pink suit's starting year is 2 less than Shaun's starting year. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    y1 == Pink and y2 == Shaun => y1_to_int == y2_to_int - 2, for all y1, y2 in starting years.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Jorge == 1, and LimeGreen == 1, and 1982 == 1, then Jorge is the skydiver who wears the lime green suit and started skydiving in 1982.

-   Jorge is either the skydiver who wears the red suit or the jumper who started in 1982:
    This is a constraint that states that Jorge's suit color is either red or Jorge started skydiving in 1982, but not both. So:
    Xor([Jorge == Red, Jorge == 1982]).

-   The skydiver who wears the pink suit started skydiving 1 year before Otis:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the starting years for the skydiver who wears the pink suit and Otis, such that the skydiver who wears the pink suit's starting year is 1 less than Otis's starting year. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    y1 == Pink and y2 == Otis => y1_to_int == y2_to_int - 1, for all y1, y2 in starting years.

-   The jumper who wears the yellow suit started skydiving sometime after Philip:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the starting years for the jumper who wears the yellow suit and Philip, such that the jumper who wears the yellow suit's starting year is greater than Philip's starting year. So, the constraints will be of the form:

The Pouchong needs 195 degree water.
The four teas are the Ali Shan, the variety that costs $6, the variety that requires 200 degree water and the tea that requires 190 degree water.

Entities:
teas: Ali Shan, Jin Xuan, Pouchong, Red Robe
prices: $4, $5, $6, $7
temperatures: 190 degree, 195 degree, 200 degree, 215 degree
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if AliShan == 1, and Price4 == 1, and Temp190 == 1, then Ali Shan costs $4 and requires 190-degree water.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the teas: AliShan, JinXuan, Pouchong, RedRobe (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Prices of the teas: Price4, Price5, Price6, Price7 (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:

-   The Pouchong costs 1 dollar less than the Red Robe:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of Pouchong and Red Robe, such that Pouchong costs $1 less than Red Robe. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    Pouchong_price == RedRobe_price - 1.

    Pouchong == Temp195.

-   The four teas are the Ali Shan, the variety that costs $6, the variety that requires 200-degree water, and the tea that requires 190-degree water:
    This is a constraint that states the four teas are Ali Shan, the tea costing $6, the tea requiring 200-degree water, and the tea requiring 190-degree water. So, the constraints will be:
    AliShan != Price6, AliShan != Temp200, AliShan != Temp190,

    This is a constraint that states that Ronda's sandwich is not the one with havarti cheese. So:
    Ronda != Havarti.

-   Ronda's order costs $5:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Ronda == Price5.

-   Lula's order is either the $3 sandwich or the order that costs $5:
    This is a constraint that states that Lula's order is either the $3 sandwich or the $5 sandwich, but not both. So:
    Xor([Lula == Price3, Lula == Price5]).

-   The sandwich with cheddar cheese costs less than the order with havarti cheese:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of prices for cheddar and havarti cheese, such that the price of cheddar cheese is less than the price of havarti cheese. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Cheddar and p2 == Havarti => p1_to_int < p2_to_int, for all p1, p2 in prices.

-   Yolanda's sandwich costs $2 less than the order with swiss cheese:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of prices for Yolanda's sandwich and swiss cheese, such that the price of Yolanda's sandwich is $2 less than the price of swiss cheese. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Yolanda and p2 == Swiss => p1_to_int == p2_to_int - 2, for all p1, p2 in prices.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Lula == 1, and Price3 == 1, and Swiss == 1, then Lula's order is the $3 sandwich with Swiss cheese.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the customers: Lula, Ronda, Sue, Yolanda (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Prices of the orders: Price2, Price3, Price4, Price5 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Types of cheeses: Cheddar, Havarti, Muenster, Swiss (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   Ronda's sandwich and the sandwich with havarti cheese are different sandwiches:
    This is a constraint that states that Ronda's sandwich is not the one with havarti cheese. So:
    Ronda != Havarti.

-   Ronda's order costs $5:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Ronda == Price5.

-   Lula's order is either the $3 sandwich or the order that costs $5:
    This is a constraint that states that Lula's order is either the $3 sandwich or the $5 sandwich, but not both. So:
    Xor([Lula == Price3, Lula == Price5]).

-   The sandwich with cheddar cheese costs less than the order with havarti cheese:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of prices for cheddar and havarti cheese, such that the price of cheddar cheese is less than the price of havarti cheese. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Cheddar and p2 == Havarti => p1_to_int < p2_to_int, for all p1, p2 in prices.

### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Beritron == 1, and January == 1, and Rubicorp == 1, then Beritron is the rocket that will launch in January and is developed by Rubicorp.

    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months of launch for Vexatech's rocket and the Exatris, such that Vexatech's rocket's month of launch is 1 more than the Exatris's month of launch. So, the constraints will be of the form:

-   The rocket developed by SpaceZen will launch sometime after the Beritron:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months of launch for SpaceZen's rocket and the Beritron, such that SpaceZen's rocket's month of launch is greater than the Beritron's month of launch. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == SpaceZen and m2 == Beritron => m1_to_int > m2_to_int, for all m1, m2 in months of launch.

-   The Worul is made by Techtrin:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Worul == Techtrin.

### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Anna == 1, and $25000 == 1, and Biology == 1, then Anna received a $25000 scholarship for majoring in Biology.

### Constraints:

Clues:
The four butterflies were the swallowtail butterfly, Rena's purchase, the insect that sold for $90, and Phillip's purchase.
Otis's purchase was either the peacock butterfly or the swallowtail butterfly.
Brandon's purchase cost 30 dollars less than Otis's purchase.
Rena's purchase cost 15 dollars less than the swallowtail butterfly.
The insect that sold for $75 was the torturix butterfly.

Entities:
winners: Brandon, Otis, Phillip, Rena

butterflies: peacock, peppered, swallowtail, torturix
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Brandon == 1, and Price45 == 1, and Peacock == 1, then Brandon's purchase was the peacock butterfly that cost $45.

-   Names of the butterflies: Peacock, Peppered, Swallowtail, Torturix (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The four butterflies were the swallowtail butterfly, Rena's purchase, the insect that sold for $90, and Phillip's purchase:
    This is a constraint that states that each of these entities corresponds to a different butterfly, thus:

    This is a constraint that states that Otis's purchase is either the peacock butterfly or the swallowtail butterfly, but not both. So:

-   Brandon's purchase cost 30 dollars less than Otis's purchase:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of prices for Brandon and Otis's purchase, such that Brandon's purchase price is 30 less than Otis's purchase price. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Brandon and p2 == Otis => p1_to_int == p2_to_int - 30, for all p1, p2 in prices.

-   Rena's purchase cost 15 dollars less than the swallowtail butterfly:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of prices for Rena's purchase and the swallowtail butterfly, such that Rena's purchase price is 15 less than the swallowtail butterfly's price. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Rena and p2 == Swallowtail => p1_to_int == p2_to_int - 15, for all p1, p2 in prices.

-   The insect that sold for $75 was the torturix butterfly:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Price75 == Torturix.

### Constraints:

    This is a constraint that states that each of these entities corresponds to a different butterfly, thus:
    AllDifferent([Swallowtail, Rena, Price90, Phillip]).

-   Otis's purchase was either the peacock butterfly or the swallowtail butterfly:
    This is a constraint that states that Otis's purchase is either the peacock butterfly or the swallowtail butterfly, but not both. So:
    Xor([Otis == Peacock, Otis == Swallowtail]).

-   Brandon's purchase cost 30 dollars less than Otis's purchase:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of prices for Brandon and Otis's purchase, such that Brandon's purchase price is 30 less than Otis's purchase price. So, the constraints will be of the form:

Clues:
The ambassador with the 9 day visit will leave sometime after Fitzgerald.
Quinn will leave 2 months after Bender.
The person leaving in January is either the ambassador with the 3 day visit or Fitzgerald.
Quinn will leave 1 month before the ambassador with the 7 day visit.

Entities:
diplomats: Bender, Fitzgerald, Owens, Quinn
months: January, February, March, April
durations: 2 day, 3 day, 7 day, 9 day
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Bender == 1, and January == 1, and Day2 == 1, then Bender is the diplomat leaving in January with a 2-day visit.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the diplomats: Bender, Fitzgerald, Owens, Quinn (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Months of departure: January, February, March, April (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Visit durations: Day2, Day3, Day7, Day9 (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The ambassador with the 9-day visit will leave sometime after Fitzgerald:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months of departure for the ambassador with the 9-day visit and Fitzgerald, such that the ambassador with the 9-day visit's month of departure is greater than Fitzgerald's month of departure. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == Day9 and m2 == Fitzgerald => m1_to_int > m2_to_int, for all m1, m2 in months of departure.

-   Quinn will leave 2 months after Bender:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months of departure for Quinn and Bender, such that Quinn's month of departure is 2 more than Bender's month of departure. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == Quinn and m2 == Bender => m1_to_int == m2_to_int + 2, for all m1, m2 in months of departure.

-   The person leaving in January is either the ambassador with the 3-day visit or Fitzgerald:
    This is a constraint that states that the person leaving in January is either the ambassador with the 3-day visit or Fitzgerald, but not both. So:
    Xor([January == Day3, January == Fitzgerald]).

-   Quinn will leave 1 month before the ambassador with the 7-day visit:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months of departure for Quinn and the ambassador with the 7-day visit, such that Quinn's month of departure is 1 less than the ambassador with the 7-day visit's month of departure. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == Quinn and m2 == Day7 => m1_to_int == m2_to_int - 1, for all m1, m2 in months of departure.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Bender == 1, and January == 1, and Day2 == 1, then Bender is the diplomat leaving in January with a 2-day visit.

    m1 == Day9 and m2 == Fitzgerald => m1_to_int > m2_to_int, for all m1, m2 in months of departure.

-   Quinn will leave 2 months after Bender:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months of departure for Quinn and Bender, such that Quinn's month of departure is 2 more than Bender's month of departure. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == Quinn and m2 == Bender => m1_to_int == m2_to_int + 2, for all m1, m2 in months of departure.

-   The person leaving in January is either the ambassador with the 3-day visit or Fitzgerald:
    This is a constraint that states that the person leaving in January is either the ambassador with the 3-day visit or Fitzgerald, but not both. So:
    Xor([January == Day3, January == Fitzgerald]).

-   Quinn will leave 1 month before the ambassador with the 7-day visit:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months of departure for Quinn and the ambassador with the 7-day visit, such that Quinn's month of departure is 1 less than the ambassador with the 7-day visit's month of departure.

Clues:
The person who came in at 8:00am asked for wheat bread.
Tricia came in a half-hour after Ora.
Of Felicia and the customer who ordered flatbread, one came in at 7:30am and the other came in at 7:00am.
Of the customer who ordered wheat bread; and the person who ordered pumpernickel, one came in at 8:30am and the other was Tricia.

Entities:
breads: flatbread, pumpernickel, rye bread, wheat bread
times: 7:00am, 7:30am, 8:00am, 8:30am
customers: Felicia, Isabel, Ora, Tricia
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Felicia == 1, and 7:00am == 1, and flatbread == 1, then Felicia came in at 7:00am and ordered flatbread.

### Decision variables:

### Constraints:
-   The person who came in at 8:00am asked for wheat bread:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    8:00am == wheat bread.

-   Tricia came in a half-hour after Ora:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the times of arrival for Tricia and Ora, such that Tricia's arrival time is half an hour after Ora's arrival time. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    t1 == Tricia and t2 == Ora => t1_to_int == t2_to_int + 1, for all t1, t2 in times of arrival.

-   Of Felicia and the customer who ordered flatbread, one came in at 7:30am and the other came in at 7:00am:
    This is a constraint that states that Felicia and the customer who ordered flatbread have different arrival times, one at 7:30am and the other at 7:00am. So:
    (Felicia == 7:30am and flatbread == 7:00am) or (Felicia == 7:00am and flatbread == 7:30am).

-   Of the customer who ordered wheat bread and the person who ordered pumpernickel, one came in at 8:30am and the other was Tricia:
    This is a constraint that states that the customer who ordered wheat bread and the person who ordered pumpernickel have different arrival times, one at 8:30am and the other being Tricia. So:
    (8:30am == wheat bread and Tricia == pumpernickel) or (8:30am == Tricia and wheat bread == pumpernickel).
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Felicia == 1, and 7:00am == 1, and flatbread == 1, then Felicia came in at 7:00am and ordered flatbread.

    t1 == Tricia and t2 == Ora => t1_to_int == t2_to_int + 1, for all t1, t2 in times of arrival.

-   Of Felicia and the customer who ordered flatbread, one came in at 7:30am and the other came in at 7:00am:
    This is a constraint that states that Felicia and the customer who ordered flatbread have different arrival times, one at 7:30am and the other at 7:00am. So:
    (Felicia == 7:30am and flatbread == 7:00am) or (Felicia == 7:00am and flatbread == 7:30am).

-   Of the customer who ordered wheat bread and the person who ordered pumpernickel, one came in at 8:30am and the other was Tricia:
    This is a constraint that states that the customer who ordered wheat bread and the person who ordered pumpernickel have different arrival times, one at 8:30am and the other being Tricia. So:

price: $500, $750, $1000, $1250
ages: 69 million, 75 million, 78 million, 85 million
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Archadon == 1, and Price500 == 1, and Age69 == 1, then Archadon is the dinosaur that costs $500 and is 69 million years old.

### Decision variables:

-   Prices of the fossils: Price500, Price750, Price1000, Price1250 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Ages of the fossils: Age69, Age75, Age78, Age85 (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The 75 million year old fossil costs $500 less than the Pilodontus:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the prices for the 75 million year old fossil and the Pilodontus, such that the price of the 75 million year old fossil is $500 less than the price of the Pilodontus. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Age75 and p2 == Pilodontus => p1_to_int == p2_to_int - 500, for all p1, p2 in prices.

-   The Senosaurus is 85 million years old:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Senosaurus == Age85.

-   The 75 million year old fossil costs $500 less than the 78 million year old fossil:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the prices for the 75 million year old fossil and the 78 million year old fossil, such that the price of the 75 million year old fossil is $500 less than the price of the 78 million year old fossil.

-   The 75 million year old fossil costs less than the Archadon:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the prices for the 75 million year old fossil and the Archadon, such that the price of the 75 million year old fossil is less than the price of the Archadon. So, the constraints will be of the form:

-   The 69 million year old fossil costs $250 more than the 78 million year old fossil:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the prices for the 69 million year old fossil and the 78 million year old fossil, such that the price of the 69 million year old fossil is $250 more than the price of the 78 million year old fossil. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Age69 and p2 == Age78 => p1_to_int == p2_to_int + 250, for all p1, p2 in prices.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Archadon == 1, and Price500 == 1, and Age69 == 1, then Archadon is the dinosaur that costs $500 and is 69 million years old.

Clues:
Henrietta's task starts 2 hours after Glenn's job.
Glenn's task is the dining room.
Glenn's chore starts 1 hour after the mud room assignment.
Henrietta's task is the living room.
The mud room assignment starts sometime before Willie's assignment.

Entities:
children: Glenn, Henrietta, Olivia, Willie
times: 8:00am, 9:00am, 10:00am, 11:00am
rooms: dining room, laundry room, living room, mud room
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Glenn == 1, and 8:00am == 1, and dining room == 1, then Glenn's task is in the dining room starting at 8:00 am.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the children: Glenn, Henrietta, Olivia, Willie (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Times of the tasks: 8:00am, 9:00am, 10:00am, 11:00am (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Rooms of the tasks: dining room, laundry room, living room, mud room (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   Henrietta's task starts 2 hours after Glenn's job:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the times for Henrietta and Glenn, such that Henrietta's task time is 2 hours after Glenn's task time. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    t1 == Henrietta and t2 == Glenn => t1_to_int == t2_to_int + 2, for all t1, t2 in times.

-   Glenn's task is the dining room:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Glenn == dining room.

-   Glenn's chore starts 1 hour after the mud room assignment:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the times for Glenn and the mud room assignment, such that Glenn's task time is 1 hour after the mud room assignment time. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    t1 == Glenn and t2 == mud room => t1_to_int == t2_to_int + 1, for all t1, t2 in times.

-   Henrietta's task is the living room:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Henrietta == living room.

-   The mud room assignment starts sometime before Willie's assignment:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the rooms for the mud room assignment and Willie's assignment, such that the mud room assignment is before Willie's assignment. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    r1 == mud room and r2 == Willie => r1_to_int < r2_to_int, for all r1, r2 in rooms.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Glenn == 1, and 8:00am == 1, and dining room == 1, then Glenn's task is in the dining room starting at 8:00 am.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the children: Glenn, Henrietta, Olivia, Willie (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Times of the tasks: 8:00am, 9:00am, 10:00am, 11:00am (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Rooms of the tasks: dining room, laundry room, living room, mud room (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   Henrietta's task starts 2 hours after Glenn's job:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the times for Henrietta and Glenn, such that Henrietta's task time is 2 hours after Glenn's task time. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    t1 == Henrietta and t2 == Glenn => t1_to_int == t2_to_int + 2, for all t1, t2 in times.

-   Glenn's task is the dining room:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Glenn == dining room.

-   Glenn's chore starts 1 hour after the mud room assignment:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the times for Glenn and the mud room assignment, such that Glenn's task time is 1 hour after the mud room assignment time. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    t1 == Glenn and t2 == mud room => t1_to_int == t2_to_int + 1, for all t1, t2 in times.

-   Henrietta's task is the living room:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Henrietta == living room.

-   The mud room assignment starts sometime before Willie's assignment:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the rooms for the mud room assignment and Willie's assignment, such that the mud room assignment is before Willie's assignment. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    r1 == mud room and r2 == Willie => r1_to_int < r2_to_int, for all r1, r2 in rooms.

Clues:
Mr. Ayers will dive on July 14.
Mr. Drake will dive 1 day after the diver going out with Hilda.
The customer going out on July 14 will go out with Hilda.
The customer going out with Vicki is either Mr. Gallegos or the customer going out on July 14.
The customer going out with Nadine will dive 1 day before Mr. Ayers.

Entities:
customers: Mr. Ayers, Mr. Drake, Mr. Erickson, Mr. Gallegos
dates: July 13, July 14, July 15, July 16
guides: Hilda, Jorge, Nadine, Vicki
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if MrAyers == 1, and July14 == 1, and Hilda == 1, then Mr. Ayers will dive on July 14 with Hilda.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the customers: MrAyers, MrDrake, MrErickson, MrGallegos (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Dates of the dives: July13, July14, July15, July16 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Names of the guides: Hilda, Jorge, Nadine, Vicki (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   Mr. Ayers will dive on July 14:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    MrAyers == July14.

-   Mr. Drake will dive 1 day after the diver going out with Hilda:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the dates for Mr. Drake and the diver going out with Hilda, such that Mr. Drake's dive date is 1 more than Hilda's dive date. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    d1 == MrDrake and d2 == Hilda => d1_to_int == d2_to_int + 1, for all d1, d2 in dates.

-   The customer going out on July 14 will go out with Hilda:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    July14 == Hilda.

-   The customer going out with Vicki is either Mr. Gallegos or the customer going out on July 14:
    This is a constraint that states that the customer going out with Vicki is either Mr. Gallegos or the customer going out on July 14, but not both. So:
    Xor([Vicki == MrGallegos, Vicki == July14]).

-   The customer going out with Nadine will dive 1 day before Mr. Ayers:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the dates for the customer going out with Nadine and Mr. Ayers, such that the customer going out with Nadine's dive date is 1 less than Mr. Ayers's dive date. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    d1 == Nadine and d2 == MrAyers => d1_to_int == d2_to_int - 1, for all d1, d2 in dates.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if MrAyers == 1, and July14 == 1, and Hilda == 1, then Mr. Ayers will dive on July 14 with Hilda.

-   The customer going out on July 14 will go out with Hilda:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    July14 == Hilda.

-   The customer going out with Vicki is either Mr. Gallegos or the customer going out on July 14:
    This is a constraint that states that the customer going out with Vicki is either Mr. Gallegos or the customer going out on July 14, but not both. So:
    Xor([Vicki == MrGallegos, Vicki == July14]).

-   The customer going out with Nadine will dive 1 day before Mr. Ayers:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the dates for the customer going out with Nadine and Mr. Ayers, such that the customer going out with Nadine's dive date is 1 less than Mr. Ayers's dive date. So, the constraints will be of the form:

The study on the Liberty starts 2 months after Eunice's project.

Entities:
students: Eunice, Felix, Natasha, Stacy
months: March, April, May, June
ships: Escape, Liberty, Odyssey, Osprey
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Eunice == 1, and March == 1, and Escape == 1, then Eunice's project on the Escape starts in March.

-   Of the assignment on the Liberty and the assignment on the Escape, one is Felix's assignment and the other starts in March:
    This is a constraint that states that one of the assignments is Felix's and starts in March, while the other is not Felix's and starts on a different month. So:
    (Liberty == Felix and Escape == March) or (Escape == Felix and Liberty == March).

-   The study on the Liberty starts 2 months after Eunice's project:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months for the study on the Liberty and Eunice's project, such that the study on the Liberty starts 2 months after Eunice's project. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == Liberty and m2 == Eunice => m1_to_int == m2_to_int + 2, for all m1, m2 in months.

Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Eunice == 1, and March == 1, and Escape == 1, then Eunice's project on the Escape starts in March.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the students: Eunice, Felix, Natasha, Stacy (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Months of the projects: March, April, May, June (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Names of the ships: Escape, Liberty, Odyssey, Osprey (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   Natasha's study starts 2 months after the project on the Odyssey:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months for Natasha's study and the project on the Odyssey, such that Natasha's study starts 2 months after the Odyssey project. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == Natasha and m2 == Odyssey => m1_to_int == m2_to_int + 2, for all m1, m2 in months.

-   Of the assignment on the Liberty and the assignment on the Escape, one is Felix's assignment and the other starts in March:
    This is a constraint that states that one of the assignments is Felix's and starts in March, while the other is not Felix's and starts on a different month. So:
    (Liberty == Felix and Escape == March) or (Escape == Felix and Liberty == March).

-   The study on the Liberty starts 2 months after Eunice's project:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months for the study on the Liberty and Eunice's project, such that the study on the Liberty starts 2 months after Eunice's project. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == Liberty and m2 == Eunice => m1_to_int == m2_to_int + 2, for all m1, m2 in months.

Clues:
The model made by Torvia costs 25 dollars more than the model made by Honwa.
The camera made by Honwa is either the Zenix 2C or the MX-827.
Of the $600 model and the FC-520, one is made by Honwa and the other is made by Dayero.
The Zenix 2C costs less than the FC-520.

Entities:
companies: Banion, Dayero, Honwa, Torvia
prices: $550, $575, $600, $625
cameras: DM-5000, FC-520, MX-827, Zenix 2C
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Banion == 1, and Price550 == 1, and DM5000 == 1, then Banion's camera model DM-5000 costs $550.

### Decision variables:
-   Companies: Banion, Dayero, Honwa, Torvia (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Prices: $550, $575, $600, $625 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Camera models: DM-5000, FC-520, MX-827, Zenix 2C (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The model made by Torvia costs 25 dollars more than the model made by Honwa:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of prices for Torvia and Honwa's models, such that Torvia's price is 25 dollars more than Honwa's price. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Torvia and p2 == Honwa => p1_to_int == p2_to_int + 25, for all p1, p2 in prices.

-   The camera made by Honwa is either the Zenix 2C or the MX-827:
    This is a constraint that states that the camera made by Honwa is either the Zenix 2C or the MX-827, but not both. So:
    Xor([Honwa == Zenix2C, Honwa == MX827]).

-   Of the $600 model and the FC-520, one is made by Honwa and the other is made by Dayero:
    This is a constraint that states that one of the $600 model and the FC-520 is made by Honwa and the other is made by Dayero. So:
    (Price600 == Honwa and FC520 == Dayero) or (Price600 == Dayero and FC520 == Honwa).

-   The Zenix 2C costs less than the FC-520:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of prices for the Zenix 2C and the FC-520, such that the Zenix 2C's price is less than the FC-520's price. So, the constraints will be of the form:

    This is a constraint that states that the camera made by Honwa is either the Zenix 2C or the MX-827, but not both. So:
    Xor([Honwa == Zenix2C, Honwa == MX827]).

    This is a constraint that states that one of the $600 model and the FC-520 is made by Honwa and the other is made by Dayero. So:

The football facility holds more people than Underwood Arena.
The basketball facility holds 80 more people than Vazquez Arena.
Young Arena holds 230 people.
Underwood Arena holds 40 fewer people than Vazquez Arena.
The facility with seating for 190 people is either the lacrosse facility or Underwood Arena.

Entities:
arenas: Gentry, Underwood, Vazquez, Young
capacities: 110, 150, 190, 230
sports: basketball, football, lacrosse, soccer
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Gentry == 1, and 110 == 1, and basketball == 1, then Gentry is the basketball facility with a capacity of 110 people.

### Decision variables:

-   Sports played in the arenas: basketball, football, lacrosse, soccer (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The football facility holds more people than Underwood Arena:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of capacities to the football facility and Underwood Arena, such that the football facility's capacity is greater than Underwood Arena's capacity. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    c1 == football and c2 == Underwood => c1_to_int > c2_to_int, for all c1, c2 in capacities.

-   The basketball facility holds 80 more people than Vazquez Arena:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of capacities to the basketball facility and Vazquez Arena, such that the basketball facility's capacity is 80 more than Vazquez Arena's capacity. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    c1 == basketball and c2 == Vazquez => c1_to_int == c2_to_int + 80, for all c1, c2 in capacities.

-   Young Arena holds 230 people:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Young == 230.

-   Underwood Arena holds 40 fewer people than Vazquez Arena:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of capacities to Underwood Arena and Vazquez Arena, such that Underwood Arena's capacity is 40 less than Vazquez Arena's capacity. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    c1 == Underwood and c2 == Vazquez => c1_to_int == c2_to_int - 40, for all c1, c2 in capacities.

-   The facility with seating for 190 people is either the lacrosse facility or Underwood Arena:
    This is a constraint that states that the facility with a capacity of 190 people is either the lacrosse facility or Underwood Arena, but not both. So:
    Xor([190 == lacrosse, 190 == Underwood]).
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet.

    c1 == football and c2 == Underwood => c1_to_int > c2_to_int, for all c1, c2 in capacities.

    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of capacities to the basketball facility and Vazquez Arena, such that the basketball facility's capacity is 80 more than Vazquez Arena's capacity. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    c1 == basketball and c2 == Vazquez => c1_to_int == c2_to_int + 80, for all c1, c2 in capacities.

-   Young Arena holds 230 people:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Young == 230.

-   Underwood Arena holds 40 fewer people than Vazquez Arena:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of capacities to Underwood Arena and Vazquez Arena, such that Underwood Arena's capacity is 40 less than Vazquez Arena's capacity. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    c1 == Underwood and c2 == Vazquez => c1_to_int == c2_to_int - 40, for all c1, c2 in capacities.

-   The facility with seating for 190 people is either the lacrosse facility or Underwood Arena:
    This is a constraint that states that the facility with a capacity of 190 people is either the lacrosse facility or Underwood Arena, but not both. So:

Clues:
Hope paid less than Delia.
Patricia had the cappuccino.
The one who had the cafe americano paid 1 dollar more than Patricia.
Hope paid more than the one who had the cafe americano.
The one who had the chai tea paid 1 dollar more than the one who had the cafe americano.

Entities:
names: Delia, Hope, Patricia, Wayne
prices: $5, $6, $7, $8
drinks: cafe americano, cafe latte, cappuccino, chai tea
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Delia == 1, and Price5 == 1, and CafeAmericano == 1, then Delia had a $5 cafe americano.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the persons: Delia, Hope, Patricia, Wayne (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Prices paid: Price5, Price6, Price7, Price8 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Drinks ordered: CafeAmericano, CafeLatte, Cappuccino, ChaiTea (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   Hope paid less than Delia:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of prices to Hope and Delia, such that Hope's price is less than Delia's price. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Hope and p2 == Delia => p1_to_int < p2_to_int, for all p1, p2 in prices.

-   Patricia had the cappuccino:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Patricia == Cappuccino.

-   The one who had the cafe americano paid 1 dollar more than Patricia:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of prices to the person who had the cafe americano and Patricia, such that the cafe americano person's price is 1 more than Patricia's price. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == CafeAmericano and p2 == Patricia => p1_to_int == p2_to_int + 1, for all p1, p2 in prices.

-   Hope paid more than the one who had the cafe americano:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of prices to Hope and the person who had the cafe americano, such that Hope's price is greater than the cafe americano person's price. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Hope and p2 == CafeAmericano => p1_to_int > p2_to_int, for all p1, p2 in prices.

-   The one who had the chai tea paid 1 dollar more than the one who had the cafe americano:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of prices to the person who had the chai tea and the person who had the cafe americano, such that the chai tea person's price is 1 more than the cafe americano person's price. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == ChaiTea and p2 == CafeAmericano => p1_to_int == p2_to_int + 1, for all p1, p2 in prices.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Delia == 1, and Price5 == 1, and CafeAmericano == 1, then Delia had a $5 cafe americano.

-   Patricia had the cappuccino:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Patricia == Cappuccino.

-   The one who had the cafe americano paid 1 dollar more than Patricia:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of prices to the person who had the cafe americano and Patricia, such that the cafe americano person's price is 1 more than Patricia's price. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == CafeAmericano and p2 == Patricia => p1_to_int == p2_to_int + 1, for all p1, p2 in prices.

The Awick drove somewhat less than the automobile with a high speed of 81 MPH.
The car with a high speed of 69 MPH drove somewhat farther than the automobile with a high speed of 81 MPH.

distances: 525 miles, 550 miles, 575 miles, 600 miles
speeds: 62 MPH, 69 MPH, 75 MPH, 81 MPH
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Awick == 1, and Distance525 == 1, and Speed62 == 1, then Awick drove 525 miles at 62 MPH.

### Constraints:

    d1 == Leden and d2 == Speed75 => d1_to_int == d2_to_int + 25, for all d1, d2 in distances.

-   The Poltris drove 25 miles farther than the automobile with a high speed of 69 MPH:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of distances for Poltris and the car with a speed of 69 MPH, such that Poltris's distance is 25 miles more than the 69 MPH car's distance. So, the constraints will be of the form:

    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of distances for Awick and the car with a speed of 81 MPH, such that Awick's distance is less than the 81 MPH car's distance. So, the constraints will be of the form:

-   The car with a high speed of 69 MPH drove somewhat farther than the automobile with a high speed of 81 MPH:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of distances for the 69 MPH car and the 81 MPH car, such that the 69 MPH car's distance is greater than the 81 MPH car's distance. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    d1 == Speed69 and d2 == Speed81 => d1_to_int > d2_to_int, for all d1, d2 in distances.

Clues:
The report from Zearing was either the August 4 report or Edith Estes's report.
Hal Harrison's report was submitted sometime after Iva Ingram's sighting.
The August 5 sighting was from Islesboro.
The report from Tarzana was submitted 1 day before the sighting from Islesboro.
Benny Baron's report was received on August 7.

Entities:
witnesses: Benny Baron, Edith Estes, Hal Harrison, Iva Ingram
dates: August 4, August 5, August 6, August 7
towns: Islesboro, Long Barn, Tarzana, Zearing
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if BennyBaron == 1, and August7 == 1, and Islesboro == 1, then Benny Baron's report was received on August 7 from Islesboro.

-   Hal Harrison's report was submitted sometime after Iva Ingram's sighting:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the dates for Hal Harrison and Iva Ingram, such that Hal Harrison's report date is greater than Iva Ingram's report date. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    d1 == HalHarrison and d2 == IvaIngram => d1_to_int > d2_to_int, for all d1, d2 in dates.

-   The August 5 sighting was from Islesboro:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    August5 == Islesboro.

-   The report from Tarzana was submitted 1 day before the sighting from Islesboro:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the dates for Tarzana and Islesboro, such that Tarzana's report date is 1 less than Islesboro's report date. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    d1 == Tarzana and d2 == Islesboro => d1_to_int == d2_to_int - 1, for all d1, d2 in dates.

-   Benny Baron's report was received on August 7:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    BennyBaron == August7.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if BennyBaron == 1, and August7 == 1, and Islesboro == 1, then Benny Baron's report was received on August 7 from Islesboro.

    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the dates for Hal Harrison and Iva Ingram, such that Hal Harrison's report date is greater than Iva Ingram's report date. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    d1 == HalHarrison and d2 == IvaIngram => d1_to_int > d2_to_int, for all d1, d2 in dates.

-   The August 5 sighting was from Islesboro:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    August5 == Islesboro.

-   The report from Tarzana was submitted 1 day before the sighting from Islesboro:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the dates for Tarzana and Islesboro, such that Tarzana's report date is 1 less than Islesboro's report date. So, the constraints will be of the form:

Clues:
Sunshine is either the condor with a wingspan of 102 inches or the 5-year-old bird.
The condor with a wingspan of 114 inches is 5 years old.
Pepper has a wingspan of 114 inches.
The four condors are the 9-year-old bird, Pepper, Merlin and the condor with a wingspan of 106 inches.
The 9-year-old bird has a wingspan 4 inches shorter than the 4-year-old bird.

Entities:
wingspans: 102 inches, 106 inches, 110 inches, 114 inches
names: Merlin, Pepper, Spike, Sunshine
ages: 4, 5, 8, 9
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Merlin == 1, and Wingspan102 == 1, and Age4 == 1, then Merlin is the 4-year-old bird with a wingspan of 102 inches.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the condors: Merlin, Pepper, Spike, Sunshine (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Wingspans of the condors: 102 inches, 106 inches, 110 inches, 114 inches (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Ages of the condors: 4, 5, 8, 9 (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   Sunshine is either the condor with a wingspan of 102 inches or the 5-year-old bird:
    This is a constraint that states that Sunshine's wingspan is either 102 inches or Sunshine's age is 5, but not both. So:
    Xor([Sunshine == Wingspan102, Sunshine == Age5]).

-   The condor with a wingspan of 114 inches is 5 years old:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Wingspan114 == Age5.

-   Pepper has a wingspan of 114 inches:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Pepper == Wingspan114.

-   The four condors are the 9-year-old bird, Pepper, Merlin, and the condor with a wingspan of 106 inches:
    This is a constraint that states the four entities, thus:
    AllDifferent([Age9, Pepper, Merlin, Wingspan106]).

-   The 9-year-old bird has a wingspan 4 inches shorter than the 4-year-old bird:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the ages for the 9-year-old bird and the 4-year-old bird, such that the 9-year-old bird's wingspan is 4 inches shorter than the 4-year-old bird's wingspan. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    a1 == Age9 and a2 == Age4 => a1_to_int == a2_to_int - 4, for all a1, a2 in ages.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Merlin == 1, and Wingspan102 == 1, and Age4 == 1, then Merlin is the 4-year-old bird with a wingspan of 102 inches.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the condors: Merlin, Pepper, Spike, Sunshine (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Wingspans of the condors: 102 inches, 106 inches, 110 inches, 114 inches (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Ages of the condors: 4, 5, 8, 9 (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   Sunshine is either the condor with a wingspan of 102 inches or the 5-year-old bird:
    This is a constraint that states that Sunshine's wingspan is either 102 inches or Sunshine's age is 5, but not both. So:
    Xor([Sunshine == Wingspan102, Sunshine == Age5]).

-   The condor with a wingspan of 114 inches is 5 years old:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Wingspan114 == Age5.

-   Pepper has a wingspan of 114 inches:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Pepper == Wingspan114.

-   The four condors are the 9-year-old bird, Pepper, Merlin, and the condor with a wingspan of 106 inches:
    This is a constraint that states the four entities, thus:
    AllDifferent([Age9, Pepper, Merlin, Wingspan106]).

-   The 9-year-old bird has a wingspan 4 inches shorter than the 4-year-old bird:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the ages for the 9-year-old bird and the 4-year-old bird, such that the 9-year-old bird's wingspan is 4 inches shorter than the 4-year-old bird's wingspan. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    a1 == Age9 and a2 == Age4 => a1_to_int == a2_to_int - 4, for all a1, a2 in ages.

Clues:
The puzzle with the autumn leaves theme has somewhat more than the jigsaw puzzle with the rustic village theme.
The four puzzles are the puzzle made by Buralde, the jigsaw puzzle with the rustic village theme, the puzzle with the autumn leaves theme and the puzzle with 1000 pieces.
The jigsaw puzzle made by Buralde has the outer space theme.
The jigsaw puzzle made by Denlend has somewhat fewer than the jigsaw puzzle with the outer space theme.
The jigsaw puzzle made by Kimsight has 250 more pieces than the puzzle made by Denlend.

Entities:
companies: Buralde, Denlend, Irycia, Kimsight
pieces: 250, 500, 750, 1000
themes: autumn leaves, coral reef, outer space, rustic village
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Buralde == 1, and 1000pieces == 1, and outerSpace == 1, then Buralde made a 1000-piece jigsaw puzzle with the outer space theme.

### Decision variables:
-   Companies that made the puzzles: Buralde, Denlend, Irycia, Kimsight (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Number of pieces in the puzzles: 250, 500, 750, 1000 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Themes of the puzzles: autumnLeaves, coralReef, outerSpace, rusticVillage (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The puzzle with the autumn leaves theme has somewhat more than the jigsaw puzzle with the rustic village theme:
    This constraint implies that the puzzle with the autumn leaves theme has more pieces than the puzzle with the rustic village theme. So, for all possible assignments of pieces to autumnLeaves and rusticVillage, we have:
    p1 == autumnLeaves and p2 == rusticVillage => p1_to_int > p2_to_int.

-   The four puzzles are the puzzle made by Buralde, the jigsaw puzzle with the rustic village theme, the puzzle with the autumn leaves theme, and the puzzle with 1000 pieces:
    This constraint states that each of these entities corresponds to one of the four options. Thus, we have:
    AllDifferent([Buralde, rusticVillage, autumnLeaves, 1000pieces]).

-   The jigsaw puzzle made by Buralde has the outer space theme:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Buralde == outerSpace.

-   The jigsaw puzzle made by Denlend has somewhat fewer pieces than the jigsaw puzzle with the outer space theme:
    This constraint implies that the puzzle made by Denlend has fewer pieces than the puzzle with the outer space theme. So, for all possible assignments of pieces to Denlend and outerSpace, we have:
    p1 == Denlend and p2 == outerSpace => p1_to_int < p2_to_int.

-   The jigsaw puzzle made by Kimsight has 250 more pieces than the puzzle made by Denlend:
    This constraint states that the puzzle made by Kimsight has 250 more pieces than the puzzle made by Denlend. So, for all possible assignments of pieces to Kimsight and Denlend, we have:
    p1 == Kimsight and p2 == Denlend => p1_to_int == p2_to_int + 1.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Buralde == 1, and 1000pieces == 1, and outerSpace == 1, then Buralde made a 1000-piece jigsaw puzzle with the outer space theme.

    AllDifferent([Buralde, rusticVillage, autumnLeaves, 1000pieces]).

-   The jigsaw puzzle made by Buralde has the outer space theme:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Buralde == outerSpace.

-   The jigsaw puzzle made by Denlend has somewhat fewer pieces than the jigsaw puzzle with the outer space theme:
    This constraint implies that the puzzle made by Denlend has fewer pieces than the puzzle with the outer space theme. So, for all possible assignments of pieces to Denlend and outerSpace, we have:
    p1 == Denlend and p2 == outerSpace => p1_to_int < p2_to_int.

-   The jigsaw puzzle made by Kimsight has 250 more pieces than the puzzle made by Denlend:
    This constraint states that the puzzle made by Kimsight has 250 more pieces than the puzzle made by Denlend. So, for all possible assignments of pieces to Kimsight and Denlend, we have:
    p1 == Kimsight and p2 == Denlend => p1_to_int == p2_to_int + 1.

Clues:
The worker who works in the green section served more riders than Brett.
Peter served 25 fewer riders than Willis.
Brett served more riders than Peter.
The person who works in the yellow section served 25 more riders than the worker who works in the orange section.
Peter is either the person who served 125 riders or the person who works in the blue section.

Entities:
employees: Brett, Peter, Victor, Willis
rides: 50 riders, 75 riders, 100 riders, 125 riders
section: blue, green, orange, yellow
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Brett == 1, and Blue == 1, and Riders125 == 1, then Brett works in the blue section and served 125 riders.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the employees: Brett, Peter, Victor, Willis (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Number of riders served: Riders50, Riders75, Riders100, Riders125 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Sections: Blue, Green, Orange, Yellow (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The worker who works in the green section served more riders than Brett:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of employees to the green section and Brett, such that the green section worker served more riders than Brett. So, the constraints will be of the form:

-   Peter served 25 fewer riders than Willis:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of riders served by Peter and Willis, such that Peter served 25 fewer riders than Willis. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    r1 == Peter and r2 == Willis => r1_to_int == r2_to_int - 25, for all r1, r2 in riders served.

-   Brett served more riders than Peter:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of riders served by Brett and Peter, such that Brett served more riders than Peter. So, the constraints will be of the form:

    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of employees to the yellow and orange sections, such that the yellow section worker served 25 more riders than the orange section worker. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    e1 == Yellow and e2 == Orange => e1_to_int == e2_to_int + 25, for all e1, e2 in employees.

-   Peter is either the person who served 125 riders or the person who works in the blue section:
    This is a constraint that states that Peter is either the person who served 125 riders or the person who works in the blue section, but not both. So:

Clues:
The team from Venezuela finished with 4 gold medals.
The squad that won 2 gold medals ended with 6 silver medals.
The four teams were the squad from Zimbabwe, the team that won 3 gold medals, the squad that won 6 silver medals and the squad that won 8 silver medals.

Entities:
countries: Dominica, Jordan, Venezuela, Zimbabwe
gold medals: 1, 2, 3, 4

    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of gold medals for Dominica and the squad that won 5 silver medals, such that Dominica's gold medals are 1 less than the squad that won 5 silver medals. So, the constraints will be of the form:

craters: Cersay, Moriwa, Ormagh, Vorckin
diameters: 100 meters, 125 meters, 150 meters, 175 meters
periods: Jurassic, Ordovician, Permian, Triassic
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Cersay == 1, and 100m == 1, and Jurassic == 1, then the Cersay impact crater has a diameter of 100 meters and was formed during the Jurassic period.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the craters: Cersay, Moriwa, Ormagh, Vorckin (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Diameters of the craters: 100m, 125m, 150m, 175m (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Periods of formation: Jurassic, Ordovician, Permian, Triassic (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The Vorckin impact crater is 125 meters wide:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Vorckin == 125m.

-   The 150 meters wide one is either the Ordovician impact crater or the Permian impact crater:
    This is a constraint that states that the 150 meters wide crater is either the Ordovician impact crater or the Permian impact crater, but not both. So:
    Xor([150m == Ordovician, 150m == Permian]).

-   The Ordovician impact crater is 25 meters wider than the Jurassic impact crater:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the diameters for the Ordovician and Jurassic impact craters, such that the Ordovician impact crater's diameter is 25 meters more than the Jurassic impact crater's diameter. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    d1 == Ordovician and d2 == Jurassic => d1_to_int == d2_to_int + 25, for all d1, d2 in diameters.

-   The Triassic impact crater is either the Ormagh impact crater or the 150 meters wide one:
    This is a constraint that states that the Triassic impact crater is either the Ormagh impact crater or the 150 meters wide crater, but not both. So:
    Xor([Triassic == Ormagh, Triassic == 150m]).

-   The Cersay impact crater was formed during the Jurassic period:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Cersay == Jurassic.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Cersay == 1, and 100m == 1, and Jurassic == 1, then the Cersay impact crater has a diameter of 100 meters and was formed during the Jurassic period.

### Constraints:
-   The Vorckin impact crater is 125 meters wide:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Vorckin == 125m.

-   The 150 meters wide one is either the Ordovician impact crater or the Permian impact crater:
    This is a constraint that states that the 150 meters wide crater is either the Ordovician impact crater or the Permian impact crater, but not both. So:
    Xor([150m == Ordovician, 150m == Permian]).

-   The Ordovician impact crater is 25 meters wider than the Jurassic impact crater:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the diameters for the Ordovician and Jurassic impact craters, such that the Ordovician impact crater's diameter is 25 meters more than the Jurassic impact crater's diameter. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    d1 == Ordovician and d2 == Jurassic => d1_to_int == d2_to_int + 25, for all d1, d2 in diameters.

-   The Triassic impact crater is either the Ormagh impact crater or the 150 meters wide one:
    This is a constraint that states that the Triassic impact crater is either the Ormagh impact crater or the 150 meters wide crater, but not both. So:
    Xor([Triassic == Ormagh, Triassic == 150m]).

-   The Cersay impact crater was formed during the Jurassic period:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Cersay == Jurassic.

Clues:
The butterfly that was auctioned 7th sold for 20 dollars less than the insect won by Daniel.
The four butterflies were the insect that sold for $260, the butterfly that was auctioned 4th, the butterfly that was auctioned 7th and the butterfly won by Roland.
The butterfly won by Gabriel was the 8th lot.

Entities:

-   The four butterflies were the insect that sold for $260, the butterfly that was auctioned 4th, the butterfly that was auctioned 7th, and the butterfly won by Roland:
    This is a constraint that states that these entities are the four butterflies, thus:

Clues:
Hattie and the student who will major in Theology are different students.
The student who will major in English is either Tracy or the student who received the $25,000 scholarship.
Hattie was awarded $10,000 more than the person who will major in Physics.
The student who received the $40,000 scholarship will major in Theology.
Ora was awarded some amount less than the student who will major in Archaeology.

Entities:
names: Erma, Hattie, Ora, Tracy
scholarships: $25,000, $30,000, $35,000, $40,000
majors: Archaeology, English, Physics, Theology
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Erma == 1, and $25,000 == 1, and Archaeology == 1, then Erma received the $25,000 scholarship to major in Archaeology.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the students: Erma, Hattie, Ora, Tracy (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Scholarship amounts: $25,000, $30,000, $35,000, $40,000 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Majors: Archaeology, English, Physics, Theology (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   Hattie and the student who will major in Theology are different students:
    This is a constraint that states that Hattie and the student majoring in Theology are different, thus:
    AllDifferent([Hattie, Theology]).

-   The student who will major in English is either Tracy or the student who received the $25,000 scholarship:
    This is a constraint that states that the student majoring in English is either Tracy or the student with the $25,000 scholarship, but not both. So:
    Xor([English == Tracy, English == $25,000]).

-   Hattie was awarded $10,000 more than the person majoring in Physics:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of scholarship amounts to Hattie and the student majoring in Physics, such that Hattie's scholarship amount is $10,000 more than the student majoring in Physics. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    s1 == Hattie and s2 == Physics => s1_to_int == s2_to_int + 10, for all s1, s2 in scholarship amounts.

-   The student who received the $40,000 scholarship will major in Theology:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    $40,000 == Theology.

-   Ora was awarded some amount less than the student majoring in Archaeology:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of scholarship amounts to Ora and the student majoring in Archaeology, such that Ora's scholarship amount is less than the student majoring in Archaeology. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    s1 == Ora and s2 == Archaeology => s1_to_int < s2_to_int, for all s1, s2 in scholarship amounts.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Erma == 1, and $25,000 == 1, and Archaeology == 1, then Erma received the $25,000 scholarship to major in Archaeology.

    This is a constraint that states that the student majoring in English is either Tracy or the student with the $25,000 scholarship, but not both. So:
    Xor([English == Tracy, English == $25,000]).

-   Hattie was awarded $10,000 more than the person majoring in Physics:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of scholarship amounts to Hattie and the student majoring in Physics, such that Hattie's scholarship amount is $10,000 more than the student majoring in Physics. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    s1 == Hattie and s2 == Physics => s1_to_int == s2_to_int + 10, for all s1, s2 in scholarship amounts.

-   The student who received the $40,000 scholarship will major in Theology:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    $40,000 == Theology.

-   Ora was awarded some amount less than the student majoring in Archaeology:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of scholarship amounts to Ora and the student majoring in Archaeology, such that Ora's scholarship amount is less than the student majoring in Archaeology. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    s1 == Ora and s2 == Archaeology => s1_to_int < s2_to_int, for all s1, s2 in scholarship amounts.

Clues:
Hatcha started 6 years after the wing back.

Entities:
players: Banben, Hatcha, Kawa, Rothvum

### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Banben == 1, and 1976 == 1, and CenterBack == 1, then Banben started playing in 1976 as the center back.

### Constraints:
-   Hatcha started 6 years after the wing back:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of starting years for Hatcha and the wing back, such that Hatcha's starting year is 6 more than the wing back's starting year. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    y1 == Hatcha and y2 == WingBack => y1_to_int == y2_to_int + 6, for all y1, y2 in starting years.

-   Kawa began playing in 1982:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:

    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Banben == CenterBack.

-   The person who started in 1985 was either Kawa or the center forward:

Clues:
The puzzle with the postage stamp theme has somewhat fewer than the puzzle made by Astury.
The jigsaw puzzle with the outer space theme has 250 more pieces than the puzzle made by Garroda.
The jigsaw puzzle made by Garroda has somewhat fewer than the puzzle made by Vesem.
The jigsaw puzzle with the postage stamp theme has somewhat more than the puzzle with the city skyline theme.
The jigsaw puzzle made by Vesem has 500 pieces.

Entities:
companies: Astury, Denlend, Garroda, Vesem
pieces: 250, 500, 750, 1000
themes: autumn leaves, city skyline, outer space, postage stamp
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Astury == 1, and 250 == 1, and AutumnLeaves == 1, then Astury made a 250-piece puzzle with the autumn leaves theme.

### Decision variables:
-   Companies making the puzzles: Astury, Denlend, Garroda, Vesem (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Number of pieces in the puzzles: 250, 500, 750, 1000 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Themes of the puzzles: AutumnLeaves, CitySkyline, OuterSpace, PostageStamp (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The puzzle with the postage stamp theme has somewhat fewer pieces than the puzzle made by Astury:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of pieces for the postage stamp theme puzzle and Astury's puzzle, such that the postage stamp theme puzzle has somewhat fewer pieces than Astury's puzzle. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    t1 == PostageStamp and t2 == Astury => t1_to_int < t2_to_int, for all t1, t2 in pieces.

-   The jigsaw puzzle with the outer space theme has 250 more pieces than the puzzle made by Garroda:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of pieces for the outer space theme puzzle and Garroda's puzzle, such that the outer space theme puzzle has 250 more pieces than Garroda's puzzle. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    t1 == OuterSpace and t2 == Garroda => t1_to_int == t2_to_int + 250, for all t1, t2 in pieces.

-   The jigsaw puzzle made by Garroda has somewhat fewer pieces than the puzzle made by Vesem:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of pieces for Garroda's puzzle and Vesem's puzzle, such that Garroda's puzzle has somewhat fewer pieces than Vesem's puzzle. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    t1 == Garroda and t2 == Vesem => t1_to_int < t2_to_int, for all t1, t2 in pieces.

-   The jigsaw puzzle with the postage stamp theme has somewhat more pieces than the puzzle with the city skyline theme:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of pieces for the postage stamp theme puzzle and the city skyline theme puzzle, such that the postage stamp theme puzzle has somewhat more pieces than the city skyline theme puzzle. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    t1 == PostageStamp and t2 == CitySkyline => t1_to_int > t2_to_int, for all t1, t2 in pieces.

-   The jigsaw puzzle made by Vesem has 500 pieces:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Vesem == 500.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Astury == 1, and 250 == 1, and AutumnLeaves == 1, then Astury made a 250-piece puzzle with the autumn leaves theme.

-   The jigsaw puzzle with the outer space theme has 250 more pieces than the puzzle made by Garroda:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of pieces for the outer space theme puzzle and Garroda's puzzle, such that the outer space theme puzzle has 250 more pieces than Garroda's puzzle. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    t1 == OuterSpace and t2 == Garroda => t1_to_int == t2_to_int + 250, for all t1, t2 in pieces.

-   The jigsaw puzzle made by Garroda has somewhat fewer pieces than the puzzle made by Vesem:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of pieces for Garroda's puzzle and Vesem's puzzle, such that Garroda's puzzle has somewhat fewer pieces than Vesem's puzzle. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    t1 == Garroda and t2 == Vesem => t1_to_int < t2_to_int, for all t1, t2 in pieces.

Clues:
The photo published by Nature Monthly was taken 2 months after the photo published by Earth Aware.
The shot of the white rhino was either the photo published by Earth Aware or the photo published by Animal Science.
The photo of the polar bear was taken sometime before the shot of the white rhino.
The photo taken in April was published by Animal Science.
The photo of the giant tortoise was taken in June.

Entities:
animals: giant tortoise, orangutan, polar bear, white rhino
months: March, April, May, June
magazines: Animal Science, Earth Aware, Nature Monthly, Wildzone
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if GiantTortoise == 1, and June == 1, and AnimalScience == 1, then the photo of the giant tortoise was taken in June and published by Animal Science.

### Decision variables:
-   Animals in the photos: GiantTortoise, Orangutan, PolarBear, WhiteRhino (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Months when the photos were taken: March, April, May, June (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Magazines that published the photos: AnimalScience, EarthAware, NatureMonthly, Wildzone (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The photo published by Nature Monthly was taken 2 months after the photo published by Earth Aware:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months when the photos were taken for Nature Monthly and Earth Aware, such that Nature Monthly's photo month is 2 greater than Earth Aware's photo month. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == NatureMonthly and m2 == EarthAware => m1_to_int == m2_to_int + 2, for all m1, m2 in months.

-   The shot of the white rhino was either the photo published by Earth Aware or the photo published by Animal Science:
    This is a constraint that states that the shot of the white rhino is either published by Earth Aware or Animal Science, but not both. So:
    Xor([WhiteRhino == EarthAware, WhiteRhino == AnimalScience]).

-   The photo of the polar bear was taken sometime before the shot of the white rhino:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the animals in the photos for the polar bear and the white rhino, such that the polar bear's photo is taken before the white rhino's photo. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    a1 == PolarBear and a2 == WhiteRhino => a1_to_int < a2_to_int, for all a1, a2 in animals.

-   The photo taken in April was published by Animal Science:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    April == AnimalScience.

-   The photo of the giant tortoise was taken in June:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    GiantTortoise == June.
### Plan:

-   The shot of the white rhino was either the photo published by Earth Aware or the photo published by Animal Science:
    This is a constraint that states that the shot of the white rhino is either published by Earth Aware or Animal Science, but not both. So:

-   The photo of the polar bear was taken sometime before the shot of the white rhino:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the animals in the photos for the polar bear and the white rhino, such that the polar bear's photo is taken before the white rhino's photo. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    a1 == PolarBear and a2 == WhiteRhino => a1_to_int < a2_to_int, for all a1, a2 in animals.

-   The photo taken in April was published by Animal Science:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    April == AnimalScience.

    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    GiantTortoise == June.

Clues:
Oginao is either the 105 ft tall fall or the 115 ft tall waterfall.
Oginao is 5 ft shorter than Irskela.
The fall in Brazil is either Cerbel or Inawatai.
Inawatai is in New Zealand.
Cerbel is 10 ft shorter than the fall in Canada.

Entities:
names: Cerbel, Irskela, Inawatai, Oginao
heights: 100 ft, 105 ft, 110 ft, 115 ft
countries: Canada, Brazil, New Zealand, Switzerland
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Cerbel == 1, and 100ft == 1, and Canada == 1, then Cerbel is the 100 ft tall fall in Canada.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the falls: Cerbel, Irskela, Inawatai, Oginao (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Heights of the falls: 100 ft, 105 ft, 110 ft, 115 ft (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Countries where the falls are located: Canada, Brazil, New Zealand, Switzerland (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   Oginao is either the 105 ft tall fall or the 115 ft tall waterfall:
    This is a constraint that states that Oginao's height is either 105 ft or 115 ft, but not both. So:
    Xor([Oginao == 105ft, Oginao == 115ft]).

-   Oginao is 5 ft shorter than Irskela:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of heights for Oginao and Irskela, such that Oginao's height is 5 less than Irskela's height. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    h1 == Oginao and h2 == Irskela => h1_to_int == h2_to_int - 5, for all h1, h2 in heights.

-   The fall in Brazil is either Cerbel or Inawatai:
    This is a constraint that states that the fall in Brazil is either Cerbel or Inawatai, but not both. So:
    Xor([Brazil == Cerbel, Brazil == Inawatai]).

-   Inawatai is in New Zealand:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Inawatai == NewZealand.

-   Cerbel is 10 ft shorter than the fall in Canada:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of heights for Cerbel and the fall in Canada, such that Cerbel's height is 10 less than the fall in Canada's height. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    h1 == Cerbel and h2 == Canada => h1_to_int == h2_to_int - 10, for all h1, h2 in heights.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Cerbel == 1, and 100ft == 1, and Canada == 1, then Cerbel is the 100 ft tall fall in Canada.

### Constraints:
-   Oginao is either the 105 ft tall fall or the 115 ft tall waterfall:
    This is a constraint that states that Oginao's height is either 105 ft or 115 ft, but not both. So:
    Xor([Oginao == 105ft, Oginao == 115ft]).

-   Oginao is 5 ft shorter than Irskela:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of heights for Oginao and Irskela, such that Oginao's height is 5 less than Irskela's height. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    h1 == Oginao and h2 == Irskela => h1_to_int == h2_to_int - 5, for all h1, h2 in heights.

-   The fall in Brazil is either Cerbel or Inawatai:
    This is a constraint that states that the fall in Brazil is either Cerbel or Inawatai, but not both. So:
    Xor([Brazil == Cerbel, Brazil == Inawatai]).

-   Inawatai is in New Zealand:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Inawatai == NewZealand.

-   Cerbel is 10 ft shorter than the fall in Canada:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of heights for Cerbel and the fall in Canada, such that Cerbel's height is 10 less than the fall in Canada's height. So, the constraints will be of the form:

### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if gigasaurus == 1, and Price500 == 1, and Age72 == 1, then gigasaurus costs $500 and is 72 million years old.

    p1 == Age90 and p2 == pilodontus => p1_to_int == p2_to_int + 250, for all p1, p2 in prices.

-   The gigasaurus costs 500 dollars more than the 78 million year old fossil:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of prices for the gigasaurus and the 78 million year old fossil, such that the gigasaurus's price is 500 dollars more than the 78 million year old fossil's price. So, the constraints will be of the form:

    p1 == gigasaurus and p2 == Age75 => p1_to_int == p2_to_int - 250, for all p1, p2 in prices.

-   The mirasaurus is 90 million years old:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    mirasaurus == Age90.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if gigasaurus == 1, and Price500 == 1, and Age72 == 1, then gigasaurus costs $500 and is 72 million years old.

The conductor working on June 12 is either the conductor departing from Indio or Roderick.
Vernon is either the person working on June 11 or the conductor working on June 13.
Francis will leave sometime before the conductor departing from Leland.

Entities:
names: Francis, Luke, Roderick, Vernon
days: June 10, June 11, June 12, June 13
departures: Hardwick, Indio, Kent, Leland
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Francis == 1, and June10 == 1, and Hardwick == 1, then Francis is the conductor working on June 10 departing from Hardwick.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the conductors: Francis, Luke, Roderick, Vernon (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Days of work: June10, June11, June12, June13 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Departure locations: Hardwick, Indio, Kent, Leland (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The four conductors are Roderick, the conductor working on June 10, the person departing from Leland, and the person departing from Indio:
    This is a constraint that states that all these entities are different, thus:
    AllDifferent([Roderick, June10, Leland, Indio]).

-   The person working on June 13 will depart from Hardwick:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    June13 == Hardwick.

-   The conductor working on June 12 is either the conductor departing from Indio or Roderick:
    This is a constraint that states that the conductor working on June 12 is either the conductor departing from Indio or Roderick, but not both. So:
    Xor([June12 == Indio, June12 == Roderick]).

-   Vernon is either the person working on June 11 or the conductor working on June 13:
    This is a constraint that states that Vernon is either the person working on June 11 or the conductor working on June 13, but not both. So:
    Xor([Vernon == June11, Vernon == June13]).

-   Francis will leave sometime before the conductor departing from Leland:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the days of work for Francis and the conductor departing from Leland, such that Francis's day of work is less than the conductor departing from Leland's day of work. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    d1 == Francis and d2 == Leland => d1_to_int < d2_to_int, for all d1, d2 in days of work.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet.

    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    June13 == Hardwick.

-   The conductor working on June 12 is either the conductor departing from Indio or Roderick:
    This is a constraint that states that the conductor working on June 12 is either the conductor departing from Indio or Roderick, but not both. So:

-   Vernon is either the person working on June 11 or the conductor working on June 13:
    This is a constraint that states that Vernon is either the person working on June 11 or the conductor working on June 13, but not both. So:

Clues:
The Kia rental is for a period 1 day shorter than the Toyota rental.
The 4 day rental is for the Fiat.
Kathy Koch's reservation is either the 5 day reservation or the Fiat rental.
The 3 day rental, Irene Ingram's reservation and Kathy Koch's reservation are all different rentals.
Ann Alexander's rental is for 4 days.

Entities:
customers: Ann Alexander, Edna Erickson, Irene Ingram, Kathy Koch
contract length: 2 days, 3 days, 4 days, 5 days
cars: Fiat, Kia, Nissan, Toyota
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if AnnAlexander == 1, and Day4 == 1, and Fiat == 1, then Ann Alexander's rental is a Fiat for 4 days.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the customers: AnnAlexander, EdnaErickson, IreneIngram, KathyKoch (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Length of the rental contracts: Day2, Day3, Day4, Day5 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Car models: Fiat, Kia, Nissan, Toyota (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The Kia rental is for a period 1 day shorter than the Toyota rental:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the rental lengths for Kia and Toyota, such that Kia's rental length is 1 less than Toyota's rental length. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    r1 == Kia and r2 == Toyota => r1_to_int == r2_to_int - 1, for all r1, r2 in rental lengths.

-   The 4 day rental is for the Fiat:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Day4 == Fiat.

-   Kathy Koch's reservation is either the 5 day reservation or the Fiat rental:
    This is a constraint that states that Kathy Koch's reservation is either 5 days or a Fiat rental, but not both. So:
    Xor([KathyKoch == Day5, KathyKoch == Fiat]).

-   The 3 day rental, Irene Ingram's reservation, and Kathy Koch's reservation are all different rentals:
    This is a constraint that states that all these entities are different, thus:
    AllDifferent([Day3, IreneIngram, KathyKoch]).

-   Ann Alexander's rental is for 4 days:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    AnnAlexander == Day4.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if AnnAlexander == 1, and Day4 == 1, and Fiat == 1, then Ann Alexander's rental is a Fiat for 4 days.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the customers: AnnAlexander, EdnaErickson, IreneIngram, KathyKoch (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Length of the rental contracts: Day2, Day3, Day4, Day5 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Car models: Fiat, Kia, Nissan, Toyota (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The Kia rental is for a period 1 day shorter than the Toyota rental:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the rental lengths for Kia and Toyota, such that Kia's rental length is 1 less than Toyota's rental length. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    r1 == Kia and r2 == Toyota => r1_to_int == r2_to_int - 1, for all r1, r2 in rental lengths.

-   The 4 day rental is for the Fiat:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Day4 == Fiat.

-   Kathy Koch's reservation is either the 5 day reservation or the Fiat rental:
    This is a constraint that states that Kathy Koch's reservation is either 5 days or a Fiat rental, but not both. So:
    Xor([KathyKoch == Day5, KathyKoch == Fiat]).

-   The 3 day rental, Irene Ingram's reservation, and Kathy Koch's reservation are all different rentals:
    This is a constraint that states that all these entities are different, thus:
    AllDifferent([Day3, IreneIngram, KathyKoch]).

-   Ann Alexander's rental is for 4 days:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    AnnAlexander == Day4.

-   Yvonne has 20 fewer Facebook friends than Margie:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of Facebook friends for Yvonne and Margie, such that Yvonne has 20 fewer Facebook friends than Margie. So, the constraints will be of the form:

### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if GiantTortoise == 1, and March == 1, and Wildzone == 1, then the photo of the giant tortoise was taken in March and published by Wildzone.

-   The photo of the orangutan was published by The Geographer:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Orangutan == TheGeographer.

    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months for the snow leopard and The Geographer, such that the snow leopard's month is 2 more than The Geographer's month. So, the constraints will be of the form:

-   Ages of the birds: 8, 9, 10, 11 (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   Charlie is 9 years old:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Charlie == 9.

-   Gracie has a wingspan of 114 inches:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Gracie == 114.

-   The 11-year-old bird has a wingspan 8 inches shorter than Charlie:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of ages for the 11-year-old bird and Charlie, such that the 11-year-old bird's wingspan is 8 inches shorter than Charlie's wingspan. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    a1 == 11 and a2 == Charlie => w1_to_int == w2_to_int - 8, for all a1, a2 in ages and w1, w2 in wingspans.

-   Angel is either the 8-year-old bird or the bird with a wingspan of 114 inches:
    This is a constraint that states that Angel is either the 8-year-old bird or the bird with a wingspan of 114 inches, but not both. So:
    Xor([Angel == 8, Angel == 114]).
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Angel == 1, and 8 == 1, and 114 == 1, then Angel is the 8-year-old bird with a wingspan of 114 inches.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the birds: Angel, Charlie, Gracie, Merlin (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Wingspans of the birds: 102 inches, 106 inches, 110 inches, 114 inches (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Ages of the birds: 8, 9, 10, 11 (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   Charlie is 9 years old:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Charlie == 9.

-   Gracie has a wingspan of 114 inches:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Gracie == 114.

-   The 11-year-old bird has a wingspan 8 inches shorter than Charlie:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of ages for the 11-year-old bird and Charlie, such that the 11-year-old bird's wingspan is 8 inches shorter than Charlie's wingspan. So, the constraints will be of the form:

    This is a constraint that states that Angel is either the 8-year-old bird or the bird with a wingspan of 114 inches, but not both. So:

Clues:
The TrustCo card has an APR of 11%.
The Southwest Inc card has a limit of $2,000.
The card with an APR of 11% is either the card with the $4,000 credit limit or the one with the $20,000 credit limit.
The card with an APR of 10% is either the card with the $4,000 credit limit or the TrustCo card.
The Credit Korp card has an APR 1 percent lower than the one with the $2,000 credit limit.

Entities:
credit cards: Credit Korp, Mid Atlantic, Southwest Inc, TrustCo
APR: 8%, 9%, 10%, 11%
credit limits: $2,000, $4,000, $5,000, $20,000
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if CreditKorp == 1, and APR8 == 1, and Limit2000 == 1, then Credit Korp has an APR of 8% and a credit limit of $2,000.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the credit cards: CreditKorp, MidAtlantic, SouthwestInc, TrustCo (all different, 1 to 4)
-   APRs: APR8, APR9, APR10, APR11 (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The TrustCo card has an APR of 11%:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    TrustCo == APR11.

-   The Southwest Inc card has a limit of $2,000:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    SouthwestInc == Limit2000.

-   The card with an APR of 11% is either the card with the $4,000 credit limit or the one with the $20,000 credit limit:
    This is a constraint that states that the card with an APR of 11% is either the card with the $4,000 credit limit or the card with the $20,000 credit limit, but not both. So:
    Xor([APR11 == Limit4000, APR11 == Limit20000]).

-   The card with an APR of 10% is either the card with the $4,000 credit limit or the TrustCo card:
    This is a constraint that states that the card with an APR of 10% is either the card with the $4,000 credit limit or the TrustCo card, but not both. So:
    Xor([APR10 == Limit4000, APR10 == TrustCo]).

-   The Credit Korp card has an APR 1 percent lower than the one with the $2,000 credit limit:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of APRs for Credit Korp and the card with the $2,000 credit limit, such that Credit Korp's APR is 1 less than the other card's APR. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    a1 == CreditKorp and a2 == Limit2000 => a1_to_int == a2_to_int - 1, for all a1, a2 in APRs.

-   The card with an APR of 10% is either the card with the $4,000 credit limit or the TrustCo card:
    This is a constraint that states that the card with an APR of 10% is either the card with the $4,000 credit limit or the TrustCo card, but not both. So:

Entities:
borrowers: Aimee, Ebony, Jimmy, Rosa
due dates: September 1, September 8, September 15, September 22
titles: Dancing Well, Frogs of Iowa, Heaven's Seal, Time to Burn
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Aimee == 1, and September15 == 1, and DancingWell == 1, then Aimee's book "Dancing Well" was due on September 15.

### Constraints:
-   The title due on September 22 is either Rosa's book or "Dancing Well":

-   Ebony's book was due 1 week after Rosa's book:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the due dates for Ebony's book and Rosa's book, such that Ebony's book's due date is 1 more than Rosa's book's due date. So, the constraints will be of the form:

-   Aimee's book was due on September 15:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Aimee == September15.

-   Ebony's book was "Heaven's Seal":
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Ebony == HeavenSeal.

-   "Heaven's Seal" was due 1 week after "Frogs of Iowa":
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the due dates for "Heaven's Seal" and "Frogs of Iowa", such that "Heaven's Seal"'s due date is 1 more than "Frogs of Iowa"'s due date. So, the constraints will be of the form:

### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if ArmorStop == 1, and Decibels100 == 1, and Year1996 == 1, then Armor-Stop was released in 1996 with 100 decibels.

-   The siren released in 2009 is either the Armor-Stop or the Viking 5:

    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the decibels for the Armor-Stop and the siren released in 2009, such that the Armor-Stop is louder than the siren released in 2009. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    d1 == ArmorStop and d2 == Year2009 => d1_to_int > d2_to_int, for all d1, d2 in decibels.

-   The Soundarm is 110 decibels loud:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Soundarm == Decibels110.

-   The siren released in 2009 is either the Armor-Stop or the Viking 5:
    This is a constraint that states that the siren released in 2009 is either the Armor-Stop or the Viking 5, but not both. So:

Clues:
The one who had the cafe americano paid 1 dollar more than the one who had the cafe latte.
Hope paid $8.
Norman paid less than Opal.
The one who had the cafe americano paid less than Linda.
The one who had the cafe mocha paid 2 dollars more than Norman.

Entities:
names: Hope, Linda, Norman, Opal
prices: $5, $6, $7, $8
drinks: cafe americano, cafe latte, cafe mocha, espresso
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Hope == 1, and Price8 == 1, and CafeAmericano == 1, then Hope paid $8 for a cafe americano.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the individuals: Hope, Linda, Norman, Opal (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Prices paid: Price5, Price6, Price7, Price8 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Drinks ordered: CafeAmericano, CafeLatte, CafeMocha, Espresso (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The one who had the cafe americano paid 1 dollar more than the one who had the cafe latte:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of prices for the cafe americano and the cafe latte, such that the price of the cafe americano is 1 more than the price of the cafe latte. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == CafeAmericano and p2 == CafeLatte => p1_to_int == p2_to_int + 1, for all p1, p2 in prices.

-   Hope paid $8:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Hope == Price8.

-   Norman paid less than Opal:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of prices for Norman and Opal, such that Norman's price is less than Opal's price. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Norman and p2 == Opal => p1_to_int < p2_to_int, for all p1, p2 in prices.

-   The one who had the cafe americano paid less than Linda:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of prices for the cafe americano and Linda, such that the price of the cafe americano is less than Linda's price. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == CafeAmericano and p2 == Linda => p1_to_int < p2_to_int, for all p1, p2 in prices.

-   The one who had the cafe mocha paid 2 dollars more than Norman:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of prices for the cafe mocha and Norman, such that the price of the cafe mocha is 2 more than Norman's price. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == CafeMocha and p2 == Norman => p1_to_int == p2_to_int + 2, for all p1, p2 in prices.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Hope == 1, and Price8 == 1, and CafeAmericano == 1, then Hope paid $8 for a cafe americano.

Clues:
The ring with the aquamarine cost less than the piece with the diamond.
Opal's ring is either the piece that cost $1300 or the piece with the diamond.
The piece that cost $1400 is either the ring with the ruby or Hazel's ring.
Hazel's ring has the diamond.
Becky's piece cost more than the ring with the diamond.

Entities:
customers: Becky, Hazel, Opal, Yolanda
prices: $1100, $1200, $1300, $1400
stones: aquamarine, diamond, ruby, topaz
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Becky == 1, and Price1100 == 1, and Aquamarine == 1, then Becky's piece, costing $1100, has an aquamarine stone.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the customers: Becky, Hazel, Opal, Yolanda (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Prices of the pieces: $1100, $1200, $1300, $1400 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Stones in the pieces: Aquamarine, Diamond, Ruby, Topaz (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The ring with the aquamarine cost less than the piece with the diamond:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of prices for the ring with the aquamarine and the piece with the diamond, such that the aquamarine ring's price is less than the diamond piece's price. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Aquamarine and p2 == Diamond => p1_to_int < p2_to_int, for all p1, p2 in prices.

-   Opal's ring is either the piece that cost $1300 or the piece with the diamond:
    This is a constraint that states that Opal's piece is either the one costing $1300 or the one with the diamond stone, but not both. So:
    Xor([Opal == Price1300, Opal == Diamond]).

-   The piece that cost $1400 is either the ring with the ruby or Hazel's ring:
    This is a constraint that states that the piece costing $1400 is either the ring with the ruby or Hazel's ring, but not both. So:
    Xor([Price1400 == Ruby, Price1400 == Hazel]).

-   Hazel's ring has the diamond:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Hazel == Diamond.

-   Becky's piece cost more than the ring with the diamond:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of prices for Becky's piece and the ring with the diamond, such that Becky's piece's price is greater than the diamond ring's price. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Becky and p2 == Diamond => p1_to_int > p2_to_int, for all p1, p2 in prices.

-   Opal's ring is either the piece that cost $1300 or the piece with the diamond:
    This is a constraint that states that Opal's piece is either the one costing $1300 or the one with the diamond stone, but not both. So:

Entities:

emperors: Diocletian, Galerius, Licinius, Nero
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Neal == 1, and 6Minutes == 1, and Diocletian == 1, then Neal talked about Diocletian for 6 minutes.

### Decision variables:

-   Emperors discussed: Diocletian, Galerius, Licinius, Nero (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   Winifred spoke for a somewhat shorter time than Omar:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the lengths of the presentations for Winifred and Omar, such that Winifred's presentation length is less than Omar's presentation length. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    l1 == Winifred and l2 == Omar => l1_to_int < l2_to_int, for all l1, l2 in lengths.

-   Neal talked about Diocletian:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Neal == Diocletian.

-   The four students were the presenter who spoke for 8 minutes, the student who gave the presentation on Galerius, Neal, and Vickie:
    This is a constraint that states the four students involved in the presentations. So, we will have a constraint that includes all these entities:
    AllDifferent([8Minutes, Galerius, Neal, Vickie]).

-   The student who gave the presentation on Nero spoke 2 minutes more than Vickie:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the lengths of the presentations for the student who presented on Nero and Vickie, such that the Nero presenter's presentation length is 2 more than Vickie's presentation length. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    l1 == Nero and l2 == Vickie => l1_to_int == l2_to_int + 2, for all l1, l2 in lengths.

-   Omar was either the presenter who gave the presentation on Nero or the presenter who spoke for 10 minutes:
    This is a constraint that states that Omar is either the presenter who gave the presentation on Nero or the presenter who spoke for 10 minutes, but not both. So:

    l1 == Winifred and l2 == Omar => l1_to_int < l2_to_int, for all l1, l2 in lengths.

-   Neal talked about Diocletian:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Neal == Diocletian.

-   The four students were the presenter who spoke for 8 minutes, the student who gave the presentation on Galerius, Neal, and Vickie:
    This is a constraint that states the four students involved in the presentations. So, we will have a constraint that includes all these entities:
    AllDifferent([8Minutes, Galerius, Neal, Vickie]).

-   The student who gave the presentation on Nero spoke 2 minutes more than Vickie:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the lengths of the presentations for the student who presented on Nero and Vickie, such that the Nero presenter's presentation length is 2 more than Vickie's presentation length. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    l1 == Nero and l2 == Vickie => l1_to_int == l2_to_int + 2, for all l1, l2 in lengths.

-   Omar was either the presenter who gave the presentation on Nero or the presenter who spoke for 10 minutes:
    This is a constraint that states that Omar is either the presenter who gave the presentation on Nero or the presenter who spoke for 10 minutes, but not both. So:
    Xor([Omar == Nero, Omar == 10Minutes]).

Clues:
Rosa paid somewhat more than the customer who got picked up at the Smith Tower.
The client with the $9 fare was picked up at the Smith Tower.
Neil paid 3 dollars more than Rosa.
The customer who got picked up at the Fremont Library was either the client with the $9 fare or Della.
The person with the $15 fare was picked up at the Neptune Theatre.

Entities:
customers: Della, Neil, Rosa, Sara
fares: $6, $9, $12, $15
pickup points: Arctic Building, Fremont Library, Neptune Theatre, Smith Tower
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Della == 1, and $6 == 1, and ArcticBuilding == 1, then Della paid $6 and was picked up at the Arctic Building.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the customers: Della, Neil, Rosa, Sara (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Fares paid: $6, $9, $12, $15 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Pickup points: ArcticBuilding, FremontLibrary, NeptuneTheatre, SmithTower (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   Rosa paid somewhat more than the customer who got picked up at the Smith Tower:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of prices to Rosa and the customer picked up at the Smith Tower, such that Rosa's price is greater than the customer's price. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Rosa and p2 == SmithTower => p1_to_int > p2_to_int, for all p1, p2 in prices.

-   The client with the $9 fare was picked up at the Smith Tower:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    $9 == SmithTower.

-   Neil paid 3 dollars more than Rosa:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of prices to Neil and Rosa, such that Neil's price is 3 dollars more than Rosa's price. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Neil and p2 == Rosa => p1_to_int == p2_to_int + 3, for all p1, p2 in prices.

-   The customer who got picked up at the Fremont Library was either the client with the $9 fare or Della:
    This is a constraint that states that the customer picked up at the Fremont Library is either the one with the $9 fare or Della, but not both. So:
    Xor([FremontLibrary == $9, FremontLibrary == Della]).

-   The person with the $15 fare was picked up at the Neptune Theatre:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    $15 == NeptuneTheatre.
### Plan:

Clues:
Evan threw the orange darts.
The player who threw the violet darts scored 7 points higher than Ira.
Ira finished with 41 points.
The player who threw the white darts finished 14 points lower than Rudy.

Entities:
players: Evan, Ira, Rudy, Zachary
scores: 41, 48, 55, 62
colors: gray, orange, violet, white
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Evan == 1, and 41 == 1, and Orange == 1, then Evan threw the orange darts and scored 41 points.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the players: Evan, Ira, Rudy, Zachary (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Scores of the players: 41, 48, 55, 62 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Colors of the darts: Gray, Orange, Violet, White (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   Evan threw the orange darts:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Evan == Orange.

-   The player who threw the violet darts scored 7 points higher than Ira:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of scores for the player who threw the violet darts and Ira, such that the player who threw the violet darts scored 7 points higher than Ira. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    s1 == Violet and s2 == Ira => s1_to_int == s2_to_int + 7, for all s1, s2 in scores.

-   Ira finished with 41 points:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Ira == 41.

-   The player who threw the white darts finished 14 points lower than Rudy:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of scores for the player who threw the white darts and Rudy, such that the player who threw the white darts finished 14 points lower than Rudy. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    s1 == White and s2 == Rudy => s1_to_int == s2_to_int - 14, for all s1, s2 in scores.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Evan == 1, and 41 == 1, and Orange == 1, then Evan threw the orange darts and scored 41 points.

    Ira == 41.

-   The player who threw the white darts finished 14 points lower than Rudy:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of scores for the player who threw the white darts and Rudy, such that the player who threw the white darts finished 14 points lower than Rudy. So, the constraints will be of the form:

Clues:
The 200 page project is either the book published in 2011 or the book published in 2010.
The book published in 2011 is either Orlando's project or Jan's project.
The book published in 2007 is 25 pages shorter than the book published in 2002.
The four projects are the book published in 2007, the 225 page assignment, Suzanne's project and the 175 page assignment.
Jan's assignment is 175 pages long.

Entities:
translators: Ebony, Jan, Orlando, Suzanne
pages: 150 pages, 175 pages, 200 pages, 225 pages
years: 2002, 2007, 2010, 2011
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Ebony == 1, and 200Pages == 1, and 2010 == 1, then Ebony's project is the 200-page book published in 2010.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the translators: Ebony, Jan, Orlando, Suzanne (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Number of pages of the projects: 150Pages, 175Pages, 200Pages, 225Pages (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Years of publication: 2002, 2007, 2010, 2011 (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The 200-page project is either the book published in 2011 or the book published in 2010:
    This is a constraint that states that the 200-page project is either from 2011 or 2010, but not both. So:
    Xor([200Pages == 2011, 200Pages == 2010]).

-   The book published in 2011 is either Orlando's project or Jan's project:
    This is a constraint that states that the book published in 2011 is either Orlando's or Jan's project, but not both. So:
    Xor([2011 == Orlando, 2011 == Jan]).

-   The book published in 2007 is 25 pages shorter than the book published in 2002:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the number of pages for the books published in 2007 and 2002, such that the book published in 2007 has 25 pages less than the book published in 2002. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == 2007 and p2 == 2002 => p2_to_int == p1_to_int + 25, for all p1, p2 in pages.

-   The four projects are the book published in 2007, the 225-page assignment, Suzanne's project, and the 175-page assignment:
    This is a constraint that states that these four entities are different, thus:
    AllDifferent([2007, 225Pages, Suzanne, 175Pages]).

-   Jan's assignment is 175 pages long:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Jan == 175Pages.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Ebony == 1, and 200Pages == 1, and 2010 == 1, then Ebony's project is the 200-page book published in 2010.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the translators: Ebony, Jan, Orlando, Suzanne (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Number of pages of the projects: 150Pages, 175Pages, 200Pages, 225Pages (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Years of publication: 2002, 2007, 2010, 2011 (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The 200-page project is either the book published in 2011 or the book published in 2010:
    This is a constraint that states that the 200-page project is either from 2011 or 2010, but not both. So:
    Xor([200Pages == 2011, 200Pages == 2010]).

-   The book published in 2011 is either Orlando's project or Jan's project:
    This is a constraint that states that the book published in 2011 is either Orlando's or Jan's project, but not both. So:
    Xor([2011 == Orlando, 2011 == Jan]).

-   The book published in 2007 is 25 pages shorter than the book published in 2002:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the number of pages for the books published in 2007 and 2002, such that the book published in 2007 has 25 pages less than the book published in 2002. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == 2007 and p2 == 2002 => p2_to_int == p1_to_int + 25, for all p1, p2 in pages.

-   The four projects are the book published in 2007, the 225-page assignment, Suzanne's project, and the 175-page assignment:
    This is a constraint that states that these four entities are different, thus:
    AllDifferent([2007, 225Pages, Suzanne, 175Pages]).

-   Jan's assignment is 175 pages long:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Jan == 175Pages.

delivery dates: October 5, October 6, October 7, October 8
cake shapes: baseball glove, bowling pin, sports car, turtle
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Danielson == 1, and October5 == 1, and BaseballGlove == 1, then Mrs. Danielson's cake will be delivered on October 5 in the shape of a baseball glove.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the customers: Danielson, Estrada, Ingram, Nolan (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Delivery dates: October5, October6, October7, October8 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Cake shapes: BaseballGlove, BowlingPin, SportsCar, Turtle (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   Mrs. Danielson's cake will be delivered 1 day before the order shaped like a sports car:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the delivery dates for Mrs. Danielson's cake and the sports car-shaped order, such that Mrs. Danielson's delivery date is 1 less than the sports car-shaped order's delivery date. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    d1 == Danielson and d2 == SportsCar => d1_to_int == d2_to_int - 1, for all d1, d2 in delivery dates.

-   The order shaped like a turtle will be delivered 2 days before Mrs. Ingram's cake:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the delivery dates for the turtle-shaped order and Mrs. Ingram's cake, such that the turtle-shaped order's delivery date is 2 less than Mrs. Ingram's cake's delivery date. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    d1 == Turtle and d2 == Ingram => d1_to_int == d2_to_int - 2, for all d1, d2 in delivery dates.

-   The cake shaped like a bowling pin is either the October 5 delivery or Mrs. Ingram's cake:
    This is a constraint that states that the cake shaped like a bowling pin is either delivered on October 5 or is Mrs. Ingram's cake, but not both. So:
    Xor([BowlingPin == October5, BowlingPin == Ingram]).

-   Mrs. Nolan's cake will be in the shape of a sports car:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Nolan == SportsCar.

-   The October 7 delivery will be in the shape of a bowling pin:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    October7 == BowlingPin.
### Plan:

    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the delivery dates for the turtle-shaped order and Mrs. Ingram's cake, such that the turtle-shaped order's delivery date is 2 less than Mrs. Ingram's cake's delivery date. So, the constraints will be of the form:

-   The cake shaped like a bowling pin is either the October 5 delivery or Mrs. Ingram's cake:
    This is a constraint that states that the cake shaped like a bowling pin is either delivered on October 5 or is Mrs. Ingram's cake, but not both. So:
    Xor([BowlingPin == October5, BowlingPin == Ingram]).

Clues:
Of Ingram Arena and Noble Arena, one holds 150 people and the other is set up for rugby games.
The lacrosse facility holds 40 more people than Wilcox Arena.
Ingram Arena holds 230 people.
Wilcox Arena holds 80 fewer people than the soccer facility.

Entities:
arenas: Frederick, Ingram, Noble, Wilcox
capacities: 110, 150, 190, 230
sports: basketball, lacrosse, rugby, soccer
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Frederick == 1, and 110 == 1, and basketball == 1, then Frederick is an arena with a capacity of 110 for basketball.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the arenas: Frederick, Ingram, Noble, Wilcox (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Capacities of the arenas: 110, 150, 190, 230 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Sports played in the arenas: basketball, lacrosse, rugby, soccer (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   Of Ingram Arena and Noble Arena, one holds 150 people and the other is set up for rugby games:
    This is a constraint that states that one of Ingram Arena and Noble Arena holds 150 people and the other is set up for rugby games. So, we can represent this as:
    (Ingram == 150 and Noble == rugby) or (Noble == 150 and Ingram == rugby).

-   The lacrosse facility holds 40 more people than Wilcox Arena:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of capacities for the lacrosse facility and Wilcox Arena, such that the lacrosse facility's capacity is 40 more than Wilcox Arena's capacity. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    c1 == lacrosse and c2 == Wilcox => c1_to_int == c2_to_int + 40, for all c1, c2 in capacities.

-   Ingram Arena holds 230 people:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Ingram == 230.

-   Wilcox Arena holds 80 fewer people than the soccer facility:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of capacities for Wilcox Arena and the soccer facility, such that Wilcox Arena's capacity is 80 fewer than the soccer facility's capacity. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    c1 == Wilcox and c2 == soccer => c1_to_int == c2_to_int - 80, for all c1, c2 in capacities.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Frederick == 1, and 110 == 1, and basketball == 1, then Frederick is an arena with a capacity of 110 for basketball.

    (Ingram == 150 and Noble == rugby) or (Noble == 150 and Ingram == rugby).

-   The lacrosse facility holds 40 more people than Wilcox Arena:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of capacities for the lacrosse facility and Wilcox Arena, such that the lacrosse facility's capacity is 40 more than Wilcox Arena's capacity. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    c1 == lacrosse and c2 == Wilcox => c1_to_int == c2_to_int + 40, for all c1, c2 in capacities.

-   Ingram Arena holds 230 people:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Ingram == 230.

-   Wilcox Arena holds 80 fewer people than the soccer facility:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of capacities for Wilcox Arena and the soccer facility, such that Wilcox Arena's capacity is 80 fewer than the soccer facility's capacity. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    c1 == Wilcox and c2 == soccer => c1_to_int == c2_to_int - 80, for all c1, c2 in capacities.

Clues:
The $35,000 structure is 15 sq ft smaller than the $29,000 home.
The Whitehead's structure sold for $29,000.
The Kirby's house is 15 sq ft smaller than the $35,000 house.
The $36,000 house is somewhat smaller than the Gillespie's structure.
Of the 110 sq ft home and the 140 sq ft home, one sold for $35,000 and the other is for the Gillespies.

Entities:
customers: Gillespie, Kirby, Pratt, Whitehead
sq footage: 95 sq ft, 110 sq ft, 125 sq ft, 140 sq ft
prices: $25,000, $29,000, $35,000, $36,000
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Gillespie == 1, and $35,000 == 1, and 110 sq ft == 1, then Gillespie's structure sold for $35,000 and has an area of 110 sq ft.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the customers: Gillespie, Kirby, Pratt, Whitehead (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Square footage of the homes: 95 sq ft, 110 sq ft, 125 sq ft, 140 sq ft (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Prices of the homes: $25,000, $29,000, $35,000, $36,000 (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The $35,000 structure is 15 sq ft smaller than the $29,000 home:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the prices for the $35,000 structure and the $29,000 home, such that the $35,000 structure's area is 15 sq ft smaller than the $29,000 home's area. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == $35,000 and p2 == $29,000 => p1_to_int == p2_to_int - 15, for all p1, p2 in square footage.

-   The Whitehead's structure sold for $29,000:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Whitehead == $29,000.

-   The Kirby's house is 15 sq ft smaller than the $35,000 house:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the prices for the Kirby's house and the $35,000 house, such that the Kirby's house's area is 15 sq ft smaller than the $35,000 house's area. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Kirby and p2 == $35,000 => p1_to_int == p2_to_int - 15, for all p1, p2 in square footage.

-   The $36,000 house is somewhat smaller than the Gillespie's structure:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the prices for the $36,000 house and the Gillespie's structure, such that the $36,000 house's area is smaller than the Gillespie's structure's area. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == $36,000 and p2 == Gillespie => p1_to_int < p2_to_int, for all p1, p2 in square footage.

-   Of the 110 sq ft home and the 140 sq ft home, one sold for $35,000 and the other is for the Gillespies:
    This is a constraint that states that one of the homes with 110 sq ft and 140 sq ft sold for $35,000 and the other belongs to the Gillespies. So:
    (110 == $35,000 and 140 == Gillespie) or (110 == Gillespie and 140 == $35,000).
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Gillespie == 1, and $35,000 == 1, and 110 sq ft == 1, then Gillespie's structure sold for $35,000 and has an area of 110 sq ft.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the customers: Gillespie, Kirby, Pratt, Whitehead (all different, 1 to 4)

    p1 == $35,000 and p2 == $29,000 => p1_to_int == p2_to_int - 15, for all p1, p2 in square footage.

-   The Whitehead's structure sold for $29,000:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Whitehead == $29,000.

-   The Kirby's house is 15 sq ft smaller than the $35,000 house:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the prices for the Kirby's house and the $35,000 house, such that the Kirby's house's area is 15 sq ft smaller than the $35,000 house's area. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Kirby and p2 == $35,000 => p1_to_int == p2_to_int - 15, for all p1, p2 in square footage.

    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the prices for the $36,000 house and the Gillespie's structure, such that the $36,000 house's area is smaller than the Gillespie's structure's area. So, the constraints will be of the form:

Clues:
The Nielsen's house is 30 sq ft larger than the $35,000 structure.
The 125 sq ft home is either the Whitehead's home or the $32,250 home.
The Whitehead's house sold for $29,000.
The Ewing's home sold for $32,250.
The $29,000 house is somewhat smaller than the $32,250 structure.

Entities:
customers: Ewing, Kirby, Nielsen, Whitehead
sq footage: 95 sq ft, 110 sq ft, 125 sq ft, 140 sq ft
prices: $27,500, $29,000, $32,250, $35,000
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Ewing == 1, and $32,250 == 1, and 110 sq ft == 1, then Ewing's house sold for $32,250 and has an area of 110 sq ft.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the customers: Ewing, Kirby, Nielsen, Whitehead (all different, 1 to 4)

-   Prices of the houses: $27,500, $29,000, $32,250, $35,000 (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The Nielsen's house is 30 sq ft larger than the $35,000 structure:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of square footage for Nielsen's house and the $35,000 structure, such that Nielsen's house's square footage is 30 more than the $35,000 structure's square footage. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    s1 == Nielsen and s2 == $35,000 => s1_to_int == s2_to_int + 30, for all s1, s2 in square footage.

-   The 125 sq ft home is either the Whitehead's home or the $32,250 home:
    This is a constraint that states that the 125 sq ft home is either Whitehead's home or the $32,250 home, but not both. So:
    Xor([125 sq ft == Whitehead, 125 sq ft == $32,250]).

    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Whitehead == $29,000.

    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Ewing == $32,250.

-   The $29,000 house is somewhat smaller than the $32,250 structure:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the prices for the $29,000 house and the $32,250 structure, such that the $29,000 house's square footage is less than the $32,250 structure's square footage. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == $29,000 and p2 == $32,250 => p1_to_int < p2_to_int, for all p1, p2 in prices.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Ewing == 1, and $32,250 == 1, and 110 sq ft == 1, then Ewing's house sold for $32,250 and has an area of 110 sq ft.

-   Of Lucia's pair and the Schtillet footwear, one was a size 7 and the other was a size 6:
    This is a constraint that states that one of Lucia's pair and the Schtillet footwear is size 7 and the other is size 6. So, we need to add constraints for all possible combinations of sizes for Lucia's pair and Schtillet footwear, such that one is size 7 and the other is size 6. The constraints will be of the form:

-   Months of project start: March, April, May, June (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Names of the ships: Liberty, Osprey, Pegasus, Serenity (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The project on the Serenity starts 1 month after Stacy's project:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months for Stacy's project and the project on the Serenity, such that the project on the Serenity starts 1 month after Stacy's project. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == Stacy and m2 == Serenity => m1_to_int + 1 == m2_to_int, for all m1, m2 in months.

-   Darryl's project starts 1 month after Gene's assignment:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months for Gene's assignment and Darryl's project, such that Darryl's project starts 1 month after Gene's assignment. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == Gene and m2 == Darryl => m1_to_int + 1 == m2_to_int, for all m1, m2 in months.

-   The study beginning in April is either the study on the Liberty or the project on the Pegasus:
    This is a constraint that states that the study beginning in April is either on the Liberty or the Pegasus, but not both. So:
    Xor([April == Liberty, April == Pegasus]).

-   Lauren's project is on the Pegasus:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Lauren == Pegasus.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Darryl == 1, and March == 1, and Liberty == 1, then Darryl's project starts in March on the Liberty.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the students: Darryl, Gene, Lauren, Stacy (all different, 1 to 4)

    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of goals for the player from the Checkers and Walls, such that the Checkers player's goals are 1 more than Walls' goals. So, the constraints will be of the form:

Clues:
Of the bird bought in February and the bird bought in January, one is Gladys's and the other is the macaw.
The macaw was bought 2 months before Ellen's pet.
The parakeet was bought 1 month after the finch.
Alberta's pet was bought 1 month before Gladys's pet.
The finch was bought sometime after the lovebird.

Entities:
names: Alberta, Della, Ellen, Gladys
months: January, February, March, April
birds: finch, lovebird, macaw, parakeet
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Alberta == 1, and January == 1, and Finch == 1, then Alberta's pet, a finch, was bought in January.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the owners: Alberta, Della, Ellen, Gladys (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Months of purchase: January, February, March, April (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Types of birds: Finch, Lovebird, Macaw, Parakeet (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   Of the bird bought in February and the bird bought in January, one is Gladys's and the other is the macaw:
    This is a constraint that states that one of the birds bought in February and January is Gladys's, and the other is a macaw. So:
    Xor([Gladys == February, Gladys == January]).

-   The macaw was bought 2 months before Ellen's pet:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months of purchase for the macaw and Ellen's pet, such that the macaw's month of purchase is 2 less than Ellen's pet's month of purchase. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == Macaw and m2 == Ellen => m1_to_int == m2_to_int - 2, for all m1, m2 in months of purchase.

-   The parakeet was bought 1 month after the finch:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months of purchase for the parakeet and the finch, such that the parakeet's month of purchase is 1 more than the finch's month of purchase. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == Parakeet and m2 == Finch => m1_to_int == m2_to_int + 1, for all m1, m2 in months of purchase.

-   Alberta's pet was bought 1 month before Gladys's pet:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months of purchase for Alberta's pet and Gladys's pet, such that Alberta's pet's month of purchase is 1 less than Gladys's pet's month of purchase. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == Alberta and m2 == Gladys => m1_to_int == m2_to_int - 1, for all m1, m2 in months of purchase.

-   The finch was bought sometime after the lovebird:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the birds bought, such that the finch's purchase is after the lovebird's purchase. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    b1 == Finch and b2 == Lovebird => b1_to_int > b2_to_int, for all b1, b2 in types of birds.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Alberta == 1, and January == 1, and Finch == 1, then Alberta's pet, a finch, was bought in January.

### Decision variables:

-   Months of purchase: January, February, March, April (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Types of birds: Finch, Lovebird, Macaw, Parakeet (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   Of the bird bought in February and the bird bought in January, one is Gladys's and the other is the macaw:
    This is a constraint that states that one of the birds bought in February and January is Gladys's, and the other is a macaw. So:
    Xor([Gladys == February, Gladys == January]).

-   The macaw was bought 2 months before Ellen's pet:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months of purchase for the macaw and Ellen's pet, such that the macaw's month of purchase is 2 less than Ellen's pet's month of purchase. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == Macaw and m2 == Ellen => m1_to_int == m2_to_int - 2, for all m1, m2 in months of purchase.

-   The parakeet was bought 1 month after the finch:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months of purchase for the parakeet and the finch, such that the parakeet's month of purchase is 1 more than the finch's month of purchase. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == Parakeet and m2 == Finch => m1_to_int == m2_to_int + 1, for all m1, m2 in months of purchase.

-   Alberta's pet was bought 1 month before Gladys's pet:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months of purchase for Alberta's pet and Gladys's pet, such that Alberta's pet's month of purchase is 1 less than Gladys's pet's month of purchase. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == Alberta and m2 == Gladys => m1_to_int == m2_to_int - 1, for all m1, m2 in months of purchase.

-   The finch was bought sometime after the lovebird:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the birds bought, such that the finch's purchase is after the lovebird's purchase. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    b1 == Finch and b2 == Lovebird => b1_to_int > b2_to_int, for all b1, b2 in types of birds.

The project headed by Dr. Ewing will go online sometime before the Zynga Complex.

### Plan:

For example, if EgertFacility == 1, and 2016 == 1, and DrBaldwin == 1, then the Egert Facility is the project headed by Dr. Baldwin and is scheduled to go online in 2016.

### Decision variables:

### Constraints:
-   The Tevatron LHC is either the facility scheduled to go online in 2019 or the accelerator scheduled to go online in 2016:
    This is a constraint that states that the Tevatron LHC's year of going online is either 2019 or 2016, but not both. So:

    Xor([DrBaldwin == FalstonLCS and DrQuinn == 2017, DrBaldwin == 2017 and DrQuinn == FalstonLCS]).

-   The project headed by Dr. Ewing will go online sometime before the Zynga Complex:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the years for Dr. Ewing's project and the Zynga Complex, such that Dr. Ewing's project's year of going online is less than the Zynga Complex's year of going online. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    y1 == DrEwing and y2 == ZyngaComplex => y1_to_int < y2_to_int, for all y1, y2 in years.

-   Of the project headed by Dr. Ewing and the facility scheduled to go online in 2018, one is the Egert Facility and the other is the Tevatron LHC:
    This is a constraint that states that one of the projects headed by Dr. Ewing and the facility scheduled to go online in 2018 is the Egert Facility and the other is the Tevatron LHC. So:

Clues:
The 2004 holiday is either the skydiving holiday or the holiday with Yvonne.
Of the kayaking holiday and the trip with Isabel, one was in 2001 and the other was in 2004.
The vacation with Andy was after the trip with Yvonne.
The holiday with Bill was 1 year after the trip with Andy.
The cycling trip was before the hunting vacation.

Entities:
friends: Andy, Bill, Isabel, Yvonne
years: 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004
activities: cycling, hunting, kayaking, skydiving
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Andy == 1, and 2001 == 1, and cycling == 1, then Andy went on a cycling trip in 2001.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the friends: Andy, Bill, Isabel, Yvonne (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Years of the holidays: 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Activities of the holidays: cycling, hunting, kayaking, skydiving (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The 2004 holiday is either the skydiving holiday or the holiday with Yvonne:
    This is a constraint that states that the 2004 holiday is either the skydiving holiday or the holiday with Yvonne, but not both. So:
    Xor([2004 == skydiving, 2004 == Yvonne]).

-   Of the kayaking holiday and the trip with Isabel, one was in 2001 and the other was in 2004:
    This is a constraint that states that one of the kayaking holiday and the trip with Isabel was in 2001 and the other was in 2004. So:
    (kayaking == 2001 and Isabel == 2004) or (kayaking == 2004 and Isabel == 2001).

-   The vacation with Andy was after the trip with Yvonne:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the years for Andy and Yvonne, such that Andy's holiday year is greater than Yvonne's holiday year. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    y1 == Andy and y2 == Yvonne => y1_to_int > y2_to_int, for all y1, y2 in years.

-   The holiday with Bill was 1 year after the trip with Andy:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the years for Bill and Andy, such that Bill's holiday year is 1 more than Andy's holiday year. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    y1 == Bill and y2 == Andy => y1_to_int == y2_to_int + 1, for all y1, y2 in years.

-   The cycling trip was before the hunting vacation:
    This is a constraint that states that the cycling trip was before the hunting vacation, thus:
    cycling < hunting.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Andy == 1, and 2001 == 1, and cycling == 1, then Andy went on a cycling trip in 2001.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the friends: Andy, Bill, Isabel, Yvonne (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Years of the holidays: 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Activities of the holidays: cycling, hunting, kayaking, skydiving (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The 2004 holiday is either the skydiving holiday or the holiday with Yvonne:
    This is a constraint that states that the 2004 holiday is either the skydiving holiday or the holiday with Yvonne, but not both. So:
    Xor([2004 == skydiving, 2004 == Yvonne]).

-   Of the kayaking holiday and the trip with Isabel, one was in 2001 and the other was in 2004:
    This is a constraint that states that one of the kayaking holiday and the trip with Isabel was in 2001 and the other was in 2004. So:
    (kayaking == 2001 and Isabel == 2004) or (kayaking == 2004 and Isabel == 2001).

-   The vacation with Andy was after the trip with Yvonne:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the years for Andy and Yvonne, such that Andy's holiday year is greater than Yvonne's holiday year. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    y1 == Andy and y2 == Yvonne => y1_to_int > y2_to_int, for all y1, y2 in years.

-   The holiday with Bill was 1 year after the trip with Andy:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the years for Bill and Andy, such that Bill's holiday year is 1 more than Andy's holiday year. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    y1 == Bill and y2 == Andy => y1_to_int == y2_to_int + 1, for all y1, y2 in years.

-   The cycling trip was before the hunting vacation:
    This is a constraint that states that the cycling trip was before the hunting vacation, thus:
    cycling < hunting.

Clues:
Ginger was either the person who paid $160 or Vicki's client.
Beulah paid 10 dollars more than Yvonne's client.
Hannah paid less than Debra.
Vicki's client paid more than Debra.
Debra paid less than Pam's client.

Entities:
clients: Beulah, Debra, Ginger, Hannah
prices: $150, $160, $170, $180
masseuses: Lynda, Pam, Vicki, Yvonne
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Beulah == 1, and Price150 == 1, and Lynda == 1, then Beulah paid $150 to Lynda.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the clients: Beulah, Debra, Ginger, Hannah (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Prices paid by the clients: Price150, Price160, Price170, Price180 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Names of the masseuses: Lynda, Pam, Vicki, Yvonne (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   Ginger was either the person who paid $160 or Vicki's client:
    This is a constraint that states that Ginger's price is either $160 or the price of Vicki's client, but not both. So:
    Xor([Ginger == Price160, Ginger == Vicki]).

-   Beulah paid 10 dollars more than Yvonne's client:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of prices to Beulah and Yvonne's client, such that Beulah's price is 10 dollars more than Yvonne's client's price. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Beulah and p2 == Yvonne => p1_to_int == p2_to_int + 10, for all p1, p2 in prices.

-   Hannah paid less than Debra:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of prices to Hannah and Debra, such that Hannah's price is less than Debra's price. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Hannah and p2 == Debra => p1_to_int < p2_to_int, for all p1, p2 in prices.

-   Vicki's client paid more than Debra:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of prices to Vicki's client and Debra, such that Vicki's client's price is greater than Debra's price. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Vicki and p2 == Debra => p1_to_int > p2_to_int, for all p1, p2 in prices.

-   Debra paid less than Pam's client:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of prices to Debra and Pam's client, such that Debra's price is less than Pam's client's price. So, the constraints will be of the form:
