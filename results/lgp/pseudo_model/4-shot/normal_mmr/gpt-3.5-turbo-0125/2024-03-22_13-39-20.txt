Clues:
The person who had the port paid 1 dollar more than Kurt.
Of the person who paid $25 and the person who paid $24, one was Priscilla and the other had the shiraz.
Of the person who paid $27 and Priscilla, one had the chianti and the other had the port.
Isabel paid $25.

Entities:
wines: chianti, port, riesling, shiraz
prices: $24, $25, $26, $27
names: Isabel, Kurt, Priscilla, Robin
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Isabel == 1, and Price25 == 1, and Chianti == 1, then Isabel paid $25 for the chianti.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the persons: Isabel, Kurt, Priscilla, Robin (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Prices paid: Price24, Price25, Price26, Price27 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Wines bought: Chianti, Port, Riesling, Shiraz (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The person who had the port paid 1 dollar more than Kurt:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the prices for Kurt and the person who had the port, such that the person who had the port paid 1 dollar more than Kurt. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Kurt and p2 == Port => p2_to_int == p1_to_int + 1, for all p1, p2 in prices.

-   Of the person who paid $25 and the person who paid $24, one was Priscilla and the other had the shiraz:
    This is a constraint that states that the person who paid $25 either was Priscilla or had the shiraz, and the person who paid $24 was the other. So:
    Xor([
        (Price25 == Priscilla, Price24 == Shiraz),
        (Price25 == Shiraz, Price24 == Priscilla)
    ]).

-   Of the person who paid $27 and Priscilla, one had the chianti and the other had the port:
    This is a constraint that states that the person who paid $27 either was Priscilla or had the chianti, and the person who paid $27 was the other. So:
    Xor([
        (Price27 == Priscilla, Price27 == Chianti),
        (Price27 == Chianti, Price27 == Priscilla)
    ]).

-   Isabel paid $25:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Isabel == Price25.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Isabel == 1, and Price25 == 1, and Chianti == 1, then Isabel paid $25 for the chianti.

    This is a constraint that states that the person who paid $25 either was Priscilla or had the shiraz, and the person who paid $24 was the other. So:
    Xor([
        (Price25 == Priscilla, Price24 == Shiraz),
        (Price25 == Shiraz, Price24 == Priscilla)
    ]).

-   Of the person who paid $27 and Priscilla, one had the chianti and the other had the port:
    This is a constraint that states that the person who paid $27 either was Priscilla or had the chianti, and the person who paid $27 was the other. So:
    Xor([
        (Price27 == Priscilla, Price27 == Chianti),
        (Price27 == Chianti, Price27 == Priscilla)
    ]).

-   Isabel paid $25:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Isabel == Price25.

Clues:
Celia used the gluten-free diet.
The friend who lost 3 pounds used the low-fat diet.
Mandy lost 2 fewer pounds than Raymond.
Mandy lost 4 more pounds than Tom.
The dieter who used the vegan diet is either Mandy or the friend who lost 3 pounds.

Entities:
pounds lost: 3, 5, 7, 9
diets: dairy-free, gluten-free, low-fat, vegan
names: Celia, Mandy, Raymond, Tom
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same quartet. For example, if Celia == 1, and 3 == 1, and DairyFree == 1, then Celia used the dairy-free diet and lost 3 pounds.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the individuals: Celia, Mandy, Raymond, Tom (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Pounds lost: 3, 5, 7, 9 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Diets used: DairyFree, GlutenFree, LowFat, Vegan (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   Celia used the gluten-free diet:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Celia == GlutenFree.

-   The friend who lost 3 pounds used the low-fat diet:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    3 == LowFat.

-   Mandy lost 2 fewer pounds than Raymond:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the pounds lost for Mandy and Raymond, such that Mandy's pounds lost is 2 less than Raymond's pounds lost. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Mandy and p2 == Raymond => p1_to_int == p2_to_int - 2, for all p1, p2 in pounds lost.

-   Mandy lost 4 more pounds than Tom:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the pounds lost for Mandy and Tom, such that Mandy's pounds lost is 4 more than Tom's pounds lost. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Mandy and p2 == Tom => p1_to_int == p2_to_int + 4, for all p1, p2 in pounds lost.

-   The dieter who used the vegan diet is either Mandy or the friend who lost 3 pounds:
    This is a constraint that states that the dieter who used the vegan diet is either Mandy or the friend who lost 3 pounds, but not both. So:
    Xor([Mandy == Vegan, 3 == Vegan]).
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same quartet. For example, if Celia == 1, and 3 == 1, and DairyFree == 1, then Celia used the dairy-free diet and lost 3 pounds.

    p1 == Mandy and p2 == Raymond => p1_to_int == p2_to_int - 2, for all p1, p2 in pounds lost.

-   Mandy lost 4 more pounds than Tom:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the pounds lost for Mandy and Tom, such that Mandy's pounds lost is 4 more than Tom's pounds lost. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Mandy and p2 == Tom => p1_to_int == p2_to_int + 4, for all p1, p2 in pounds lost.

Trevor performed 2 spots before the performer who used chainsaws.

Entities:
orders: first, second, third, fourth

items: batons, bowling pins, chainsaws, rings
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same quartet. For example, if Melissa == 1, and First == 1, and Batons == 1, then Melissa used batons and performed first.

-   Of the performer who used bowling pins and the juggler who went fourth, one is Melissa and the other is Yolanda:
    This is a constraint that states that one used bowling pins and went fourth, and the other is a juggler named Melissa or Yolanda. So:

        (BowlingPins == Yolanda, Fourth == Melissa)
    ]).

-   The juggler who used bowling pins was either Yolanda or the juggler who went second:
    This is a constraint that states that the juggler who used bowling pins is either Yolanda or the juggler who went second, but not both. So:
    Xor([BowlingPins == Yolanda, BowlingPins == Second]).

-   Trevor performed 2 spots before the performer who used chainsaws:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the orders for Trevor and the performer who used chainsaws, such that Trevor's order is 2 spots before the performer who used chainsaws. So, the constraints will be of the form:

        (BowlingPins == Melissa, Fourth == Yolanda),
        (BowlingPins == Yolanda, Fourth == Melissa)
    ]).

-   The juggler who used bowling pins was either Yolanda or the juggler who went second:
    This is a constraint that states that the juggler who used bowling pins is either Yolanda or the juggler who went second, but not both. So:

-   Trevor performed 2 spots before the performer who used chainsaws:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the orders for Trevor and the performer who used chainsaws, such that Trevor's order is 2 spots before the performer who used chainsaws. So, the constraints will be of the form:

-   Edna Easton has 6 more wins than Irma:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of wins for Edna Easton and Irma, such that Edna Easton's wins are 6 more than Irma's wins. So, the constraints will be of the form:

-   Of the boxer with 33 wins and the fighter with 27 wins, one is Sonia and the other has 12 losses:
    This is a constraint that states that one of the boxers has 33 wins and the other has 27 wins, and one of them is Sonia and the other has 12 losses. So, the constraints will be:
    (Wins33 == Sonia and Wins27_to_int == 12) or (Wins27 == Sonia and Wins33_to_int == 12).

-   The boxer with 12 losses is either the fighter with 33 wins or Jane:
    This is a constraint that states that the boxer with 12 losses is either the fighter with 33 wins or Jane, but not both. So:

The person who has been studying the Xozix culture will publish 1 month before the person who has been studying the Haleyito culture.
Of the student who will publish in March and the person who has been studying the Xozix culture, one is Luther and the other is Yvette.
Vera will publish 1 month before Luther.

Entities:
months: January, February, March, April
names: Ira, Luther, Vera, Yvette
cultures: Cheer, Garyk, Haleyito, Xozix
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Ira == 1, and January == 1, and Cheer == 1, then Ira will publish in January and has been studying the Cheer culture.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the individuals: Ira, Luther, Vera, Yvette (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Months of publication: January, February, March, April (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Cultures studied: Cheer, Garyk, Haleyito, Xozix (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The person who will publish in January is either the person who has been studying the Cheer culture or Ira:
    This is a constraint that states that the person publishing in January is either studying the Cheer culture or is Ira, but not both. So:
    Xor([January == Cheer, January == Ira]).

-   The person who has been studying the Xozix culture will publish 1 month before the person who has been studying the Haleyito culture:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of cultures to Xozix and Haleyito, such that the person studying Xozix will publish 1 month before the person studying Haleyito. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    c1 == Xozix and c2 == Haleyito => c1_to_int == c2_to_int - 1, for all c1, c2 in cultures.

-   Of the student who will publish in March and the person who has been studying the Xozix culture, one is Luther and the other is Yvette:
    This is a constraint that states that one of Luther or Yvette will publish in March and the other will be studying the Xozix culture. So:
    (March == Luther and Xozix == Yvette) or (March == Yvette and Xozix == Luther).

-   Vera will publish 1 month before Luther:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of months to Vera and Luther, such that Vera will publish 1 month before Luther. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == Vera and m2 == Luther => m1_to_int == m2_to_int - 1, for all m1, m2 in months.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Ira == 1, and January == 1, and Cheer == 1, then Ira will publish in January and has been studying the Cheer culture.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the individuals: Ira, Luther, Vera, Yvette (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Months of publication: January, February, March, April (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Cultures studied: Cheer, Garyk, Haleyito, Xozix (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The person who will publish in January is either the person who has been studying the Cheer culture or Ira:
    This is a constraint that states that the person publishing in January is either studying the Cheer culture or is Ira, but not both. So:
    Xor([January == Cheer, January == Ira]).

-   The person who has been studying the Xozix culture will publish 1 month before the person who has been studying the Haleyito culture:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of cultures to Xozix and Haleyito, such that the person studying Xozix will publish 1 month before the person studying Haleyito. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    c1 == Xozix and c2 == Haleyito => c1_to_int == c2_to_int - 1, for all c1, c2 in cultures.

-   Of the student who will publish in March and the person who has been studying the Xozix culture, one is Luther and the other is Yvette:
    This is a constraint that states that one of Luther or Yvette will publish in March and the other will be studying the Xozix culture. So:
    (March == Luther and Xozix == Yvette) or (March == Yvette and Xozix == Luther).

-   Vera will publish 1 month before Luther:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of months to Vera and Luther, such that Vera will publish 1 month before Luther. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == Vera and m2 == Luther => m1_to_int == m2_to_int - 1, for all m1, m2 in months.

-   Ira will leave 1 day before the conductor departing from Manson:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the dates for Ira and the conductor departing from Manson, such that Ira's departure date is 1 day before the conductor's departure date. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    d1 == Ira and d2 == Manson => d1_to_int == d2_to_int - 1, for all d1, d2 in dates.

-   The person departing from Buttonwillow will leave 1 day before the conductor departing from Indio:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the dates for the person departing from Buttonwillow and the conductor departing from Indio, such that the person departing from Buttonwillow's departure date is 1 day before the conductor's departure date. So, the constraints will be of the form:

Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Jorge == 1, and Year1982 == 1, and Red == 1, then Jorge is the skydiver who started in 1982 and wears the red suit.

    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the start years for the skydiver who wears the pink suit and Otis, such that the pink suit's start year is 1 year before Otis's start year. So, the constraints will be of the form:

-   The jumper who wears the lime green suit started skydiving sometime after the jumper who wears the yellow suit:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the start years for the jumper who wears the lime green suit and the jumper who wears the yellow suit, such that the lime green suit's start year is after the yellow suit's start year. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    y1 == LimeGreen and y2 == Yellow => y1_to_int > y2_to_int, for all y1, y2 in start years.

    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the start years for the jumper who wears the pink suit and Shaun, such that the pink suit's start year is 2 years before Shaun's start year. So, the constraints will be of the form:

Clues:
The ambassador with the 9 day visit will leave sometime after Fitzgerald.
Quinn will leave 2 months after Bender.
The person leaving in January is either the ambassador with the 3 day visit or Fitzgerald.
Quinn will leave 1 month before the ambassador with the 7 day visit.

Entities:
diplomats: Bender, Fitzgerald, Owens, Quinn
months: January, February, March, April
durations: 2 day, 3 day, 7 day, 9 day
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same quartet. For example, if Bender == 1, and January == 1, and Day3 == 1, then Bender is the diplomat leaving in January with a 3-day visit.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the diplomats: Bender, Fitzgerald, Owens, Quinn (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Months of departure: January, February, March, April (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Durations of visit: Day2, Day3, Day7, Day9 (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The ambassador with the 9-day visit will leave sometime after Fitzgerald:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the diplomats for the ambassador with the 9-day visit and Fitzgerald, such that the ambassador with the 9-day visit leaves after Fitzgerald. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    d1 == Fitzgerald and d2 == Day9 => d1_to_int < d2_to_int, for all d1, d2 in diplomats.

-   Quinn will leave 2 months after Bender:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months of departure for Quinn and Bender, such that Quinn leaves 2 months after Bender. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == Quinn and m2 == Bender => m1_to_int == m2_to_int + 2, for all m1, m2 in months of departure.

-   The person leaving in January is either the ambassador with the 3-day visit or Fitzgerald:
    This is a constraint that states that the person leaving in January is either the ambassador with the 3-day visit or Fitzgerald, but not both. So:
    Xor([January == Day3, January == Fitzgerald]).

-   Quinn will leave 1 month before the ambassador with the 7-day visit:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months of departure for Quinn and the ambassador with the 7-day visit, such that Quinn leaves 1 month before the ambassador with the 7-day visit. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == Quinn and m2 == Day7 => m1_to_int == m2_to_int - 1, for all m1, m2 in months of departure.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same quartet.

-   Quinn will leave 2 months after Bender:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months of departure for Quinn and Bender, such that Quinn leaves 2 months after Bender. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == Quinn and m2 == Bender => m1_to_int == m2_to_int + 2, for all m1, m2 in months of departure.

    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months of departure for Quinn and the ambassador with the 7-day visit, such that Quinn leaves 1 month before the ambassador with the 7-day visit. So, the constraints will be of the form:

Clues:
Ultra Hex is Gabe Grant.
Criminal Bane is either the hero who started in 2007 or the superhero who started in 2009.
Peter Powers began sometime before Matt Minkle.
Gabe Grant began 1 year after Wonderman.
The four people are Deep Shadow, the superhero who started in 2007, the hero who started in 2009 and Matt Minkle.

Entities:
years: 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010
superheroes: Criminal Bane, Deep Shadow, Ultra Hex, Wonderman
names: Gabe Grant, Ivor Ingram, Matt Minkle, Peter Powers
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same quartet. For example, if DeepShadow == 1, and 2007 == 1, and CriminalBane == 1, then Deep Shadow is the superhero who started in 2007 and is Criminal Bane.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the superheroes: CriminalBane, DeepShadow, UltraHex, Wonderman (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Years of starting: Year2007, Year2008, Year2009, Year2010 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Real names: GabeGrant, IvorIngram, MattMinkle, PeterPowers (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   Ultra Hex is Gabe Grant:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    UltraHex == GabeGrant.

-   Criminal Bane is either the hero who started in 2007 or the superhero who started in 2009:
    This is a constraint that states that Criminal Bane's starting year is either 2007 or 2009, but not both. So:
    Xor([CriminalBane == Year2007, CriminalBane == Year2009]).

-   Peter Powers began sometime before Matt Minkle:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the starting years for Peter Powers and Matt Minkle, such that Peter Powers's starting year is less than Matt Minkle's starting year. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    y1 == PeterPowers and y2 == MattMinkle => y1_to_int < y2_to_int, for all y1, y2 in years.

-   Gabe Grant began 1 year after Wonderman:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the starting years for Gabe Grant and Wonderman, such that Gabe Grant's starting year is 1 more than Wonderman's starting year. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    y1 == GabeGrant and y2 == Wonderman => y1_to_int == y2_to_int + 1, for all y1, y2 in years.

-   The four people are Deep Shadow, the superhero who started in 2007, the hero who started in 2009, and Matt Minkle:
    This is a constraint that states that all these entities are different, thus:
    AllDifferent([DeepShadow, Year2007, Year2009, MattMinkle]).
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same quartet. For example, if DeepShadow == 1, and 2007 == 1, and CriminalBane == 1, then Deep Shadow is the superhero who started in 2007 and is Criminal Bane.

### Constraints:
-   Ultra Hex is Gabe Grant:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    UltraHex == GabeGrant.

-   Criminal Bane is either the hero who started in 2007 or the superhero who started in 2009:
    This is a constraint that states that Criminal Bane's starting year is either 2007 or 2009, but not both. So:
    Xor([CriminalBane == Year2007, CriminalBane == Year2009]).

-   Peter Powers began sometime before Matt Minkle:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the starting years for Peter Powers and Matt Minkle, such that Peter Powers's starting year is less than Matt Minkle's starting year. So, the constraints will be of the form:

Clues:
The Sancode interview is 1 day after the meeting for the copywriter position.
The Laneplex interview is on August 20th.
The meeting for the copywriter position is 2 days before the meeting for the web developer position.

companies: Canway, Haytouch, Laneplex, Sancode
positions: copywriter, janitor, sales rep, web developer
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if August20th == 1, and Canway == 1, and Copywriter == 1, then the meeting for the copywriter position at Canway is on August 20th.

### Decision variables:

-   The Laneplex interview is on August 20th:
    This is a constraint that directly states the assignment of the Laneplex interview to August 20th:
    Laneplex == August20th.

-   The meeting for the copywriter position is 2 days before the meeting for the web developer position:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of days for the copywriter meeting and the web developer meeting, such that the copywriter meeting is 2 days before the web developer meeting. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    d1 == Copywriter and d2 == WebDeveloper => d1_to_int == d2_to_int - 2, for all d1, d2 in days.

-   The Haytouch interview is for the sales rep job:
    This is a constraint that directly states the assignment of the Haytouch interview to the sales rep job:
    Haytouch == SalesRep.
### Plan:

    This is a constraint that directly states the assignment of the Laneplex interview to August 20th:
    Laneplex == August20th.

-   The meeting for the copywriter position is 2 days before the meeting for the web developer position:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of days for the copywriter meeting and the web developer meeting, such that the copywriter meeting is 2 days before the web developer meeting. So, the constraints will be of the form:

The Aspen Court project begins sometime after Dawn Daniels's project.

Entities:
months: April, May, June, July
streets: Aspen Court, Norway Court, Oak Road, Quince Street
managers: Bill Bonner, Dawn Daniels, Freda Fisher, Irma Ingram
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if April == 1, and AspenCourt == 1, and BillBonner == 1, then the project starting in April on Aspen Court is headed by Bill Bonner.

-   Of the job starting in July and the job starting in April, one will focus on Oak Road and the other will be headed by Freda Fisher:
    This is a constraint that states that one of the projects starting in July and April will focus on Oak Road and the other will be headed by Freda Fisher, but not both. So:
    Xor([

-   The Aspen Court project starts in May:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    AspenCourt == May.

-   The Aspen Court project begins sometime after Dawn Daniels's project:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months for Dawn Daniels's project and the Aspen Court project, such that the Aspen Court project's month is greater than Dawn Daniels's project's month. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == DawnDaniels and m2 == AspenCourt => m2_to_int > m1_to_int, for all m1, m2 in months.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet.

    This is a constraint that states that one of the projects starting in May and Oak Road will be headed by Dawn Daniels and the other by Irma Ingram, but not both. So:
    Xor([
        (May == DawnDaniels, OakRoad == IrmaIngram),

-   The Aspen Court project starts in May:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    AspenCourt == May.

-   The Aspen Court project begins sometime after Dawn Daniels's project:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months for Dawn Daniels's project and the Aspen Court project, such that the Aspen Court project's month is greater than Dawn Daniels's project's month. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == DawnDaniels and m2 == AspenCourt => m2_to_int > m1_to_int, for all m1, m2 in months.

Clues:
Of Sophie and Gwen, one will bring their rabbit's foot and the other will leave in January.
Sophie will leave sometime before Gwen.
The passenger with the lucky hat, Gwen and Sophie are all different fliers.
Florence will leave 2 months after the passenger with the lucky hat.
The passenger leaving in April is either Gwen or the passenger with the talisman.

Entities:
months: January, February, March, April
fliers: Florence, Gwen, Olive, Sophie
lucky charms: coin, lucky hat, rabbit's foot, talisman
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same quartet. For example, if January == 1, and Florence == 1, and Coin == 1, then Florence will leave in January with a coin.

### Decision variables:
-   Months of departure: January, February, March, April (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Names of the fliers: Florence, Gwen, Olive, Sophie (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Types of lucky charms: Coin, LuckyHat, RabbitsFoot, Talisman (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   Of Sophie and Gwen, one will bring their rabbit's foot and the other will leave in January:
    This is a constraint that states that Sophie and Gwen are different and one will bring the rabbit's foot while the other will leave in January. So:
    Xor([Sophie == RabbitsFoot, Gwen == RabbitsFoot])
    Xor([Sophie == January, Gwen == January]).

-   Sophie will leave sometime before Gwen:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months of departure for Sophie and Gwen, such that Sophie's month of departure is less than Gwen's month of departure. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == Sophie and m2 == Gwen => m1_to_int < m2_to_int, for all m1, m2 in months of departure.

-   The passenger with the lucky hat, Gwen, and Sophie are all different fliers:
    This is a constraint that states that all these entities are different, thus:
    AllDifferent([LuckyHat, Gwen, Sophie]).

-   Florence will leave 2 months after the passenger with the lucky hat:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months of departure for Florence and the passenger with the lucky hat, such that Florence's month of departure is 2 months after the lucky hat's month of departure. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == Florence and m2 == LuckyHat => m1_to_int == m2_to_int + 2, for all m1, m2 in months of departure.

-   The passenger leaving in April is either Gwen or the passenger with the talisman:
    This is a constraint that states that the passenger leaving in April is either Gwen or the passenger with the talisman, but not both. So:
    Xor([April == Gwen, April == Talisman]).
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same quartet. For example, if January == 1, and Florence == 1, and Coin == 1, then Florence will leave in January with a coin.

-   The passenger with the lucky hat, Gwen, and Sophie are all different fliers:
    This is a constraint that states that all these entities are different, thus:

    This is a constraint that states that the passenger leaving in April is either Gwen or the passenger with the talisman, but not both. So:

The Munei is going to Mars.
The Munei launched 1 month after the mission going to Pluto.
Of the mission going to Ganymede and the mission going to Pluto, one launched in March and the other is the Chano.

Entities:
months: January, February, March, April
probes: Ateyin, Chano, Iunsel, Munei
destinations: Ganymede, Mars, Pluto, Uranus
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Ateyin == 1, and January == 1, and Ganymede == 1, then Ateyin is the probe that is going to Ganymede and launched in January.

-   The Munei is going to Mars:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:

-   The Munei launched 1 month after the mission going to Pluto:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months of launch for the Munei and the mission going to Pluto, such that Munei's month of launch is 1 month after the mission going to Pluto's month of launch. So, the constraints will be of the form:

-   Of the mission going to Ganymede and the mission going to Pluto, one launched in March and the other is the Chano:
    This is a constraint that states that one of the missions going to Ganymede and Pluto launched in March, and the other is the Chano. So:
    Xor([

### Plan:

Clues:
The blue topaz sold for 10 dollars more than the gem found in the Osborne claim.
The rhodolite went for $820.
The tourmaline is either the gem that sold for $810 or the gem found in the Underwood claim.
Of the gem found in the Collins claim and the aquamarine, one went for $790 and the other went for $800.

Entities:
prices: $790, $800, $810, $820
gems: aquamarine, blue topaz, rhodolite, tourmaline
claims: Collins, Knox, Osborne, Underwood
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if $790 == 1, and aquamarine == 1, and Collins == 1, then the gem found in the Collins claim went for $790 and is an aquamarine.

### Decision variables:
-   Prices of the gems: Price790, Price800, Price810, Price820 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Names of the gems: aquamarine, blue topaz, rhodolite, tourmaline (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Claims where gems were found: Collins, Knox, Osborne, Underwood (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The blue topaz sold for 10 dollars more than the gem found in the Osborne claim:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of prices for the blue topaz and the gem found in the Osborne claim, such that the blue topaz's price is 10 dollars more than the gem found in the Osborne claim. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == blue topaz and p2 == Osborne => p1_to_int == p2_to_int + 10, for all p1, p2 in prices.

-   The rhodolite went for $820:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    rhodolite == Price820.

-   The tourmaline is either the gem that sold for $810 or the gem found in the Underwood claim:
    This is a constraint that states that the tourmaline is either the gem that sold for $810 or the gem found in the Underwood claim, but not both. Thus:
    Xor([tourmaline == Price810, tourmaline == Underwood]).

-   Of the gem found in the Collins claim and the aquamarine, one went for $790 and the other went for $800:
    This is a constraint that states that one of the gems found in the Collins claim and the aquamarine went for $790 and the other went for $800. Thus:
    (Collins == Price790 and aquamarine == Price800) or (Collins == Price800 and aquamarine == Price790).
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if $790 == 1, and aquamarine == 1, and Collins == 1, then the gem found in the Collins claim went for $790 and is an aquamarine.

    rhodolite == Price820.

-   The tourmaline is either the gem that sold for $810 or the gem found in the Underwood claim:
    This is a constraint that states that the tourmaline is either the gem that sold for $810 or the gem found in the Underwood claim, but not both. Thus:

The reactor launching in April is either the direct drive facility or the z-pinch facility.
Of the fusor reactor and the z-pinch facility, one will launch in February and the other is the Kuchiwa W10.
The Essita CBT will launch in February.

Entities:
months: January, February, March, April
names: Essita CBT, Haramarui LV, Kuchiwa W10, Rodim-Rexit
types: direct drive, fusor, tokamak, z-pinch
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if EssitaCBT == 1, and January == 1, and Tokamak == 1, then Essita CBT is the tokamak reactor launching in January.

### Decision variables:

### Constraints:
-   The facility launching in March is the tokamak reactor:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    March == Tokamak.

-   The reactor launching in April is either the direct drive facility or the z-pinch facility:
    This is a constraint that states that the reactor launching in April is either associated with the direct drive type or the z-pinch type, but not both. So:
    Xor([April == DirectDrive, April == ZPinch]).

-   Of the fusor reactor and the z-pinch facility, one will launch in February and the other is the Kuchiwa W10:
    This is a constraint that states that one of the fusor reactor and the z-pinch facility will launch in February, and the other one is the Kuchiwa W10. So:
    Xor([
        (February == Fusor, February == ZPinch, KuchiwaW10 == ZPinch),
        (February == KuchiwaW10, KuchiwaW10 == ZPinch, February == Fusor)
    ]).

-   The Essita CBT will launch in February:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    February == EssitaCBT.

-   The Haramarui LV will launch 1 month before the fusor reactor:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months for the Haramarui LV and the fusor reactor, such that the Haramarui LV's month of launch is 1 month before the fusor reactor's month of launch. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == HaramaruiLV and m2 == Fusor => m1_to_int == m2_to_int - 1, for all m1, m2 in months.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if EssitaCBT == 1, and January == 1, and Tokamak == 1, then Essita CBT is the tokamak reactor launching in January.

### Decision variables:

-   The facility launching in March is the tokamak reactor:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    March == Tokamak.

-   The reactor launching in April is either the direct drive facility or the z-pinch facility:
    This is a constraint that states that the reactor launching in April is either associated with the direct drive type or the z-pinch type, but not both. So:
    Xor([April == DirectDrive, April == ZPinch]).

-   Of the fusor reactor and the z-pinch facility, one will launch in February and the other is the Kuchiwa W10:
    This is a constraint that states that one of the fusor reactor and the z-pinch facility will launch in February, and the other one is the Kuchiwa W10. So:
    Xor([
        (February == Fusor, February == ZPinch, KuchiwaW10 == ZPinch),
        (February == KuchiwaW10, KuchiwaW10 == ZPinch, February == Fusor)
    ]).

-   The Essita CBT will launch in February:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    February == EssitaCBT.

    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months for the Haramarui LV and the fusor reactor, such that the Haramarui LV's month of launch is 1 month before the fusor reactor's month of launch. So, the constraints will be of the form:

Clues:
Of the anniversary event and the event with 100 attendees, one will be handled by Joel and the other will be handled by Susan.
Herbert's assignment will involve 25 fewer people than Susan's assignment.
Of the assignment with 75 attendees and the assignment with 100 attendees, one will be handled by Susan and the other is the birthday.
Herbert's event is either the event with 50 attendees or the graduation job.

Entities:
people: 50, 75, 100, 125
planners: Herbert, Joel, Susan, Teresa
events: anniversary, birthday, graduation, wedding
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Herbert == 1, and People50 == 1, and Anniversary == 1, then Herbert's assignment involves 50 people for the anniversary event.

### Decision variables:

### Constraints:
-   Of the anniversary event and the event with 100 attendees, one will be handled by Joel and the other will be handled by Susan:
    This is a constraint that states that one of the events will be handled by Joel and the other by Susan, but not both. So:

-   Herbert's assignment will involve 25 fewer people than Susan's assignment:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the number of people for Herbert and Susan's assignments, such that Herbert's assignment involves 25 fewer people than Susan's assignment. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Herbert and p2 == Susan => p1_to_int == p2_to_int - 25, for all p1, p2 in people.

-   Of the assignment with 75 attendees and the assignment with 100 attendees, one will be handled by Susan and the other is the birthday:
    This is a constraint that states that one of the assignments will be handled by Susan and the other is the birthday event, but not both. So:
    Xor([People75 == Susan, People100 == Susan, People75 == Birthday, People100 == Birthday]).

-   Herbert's event is either the event with 50 attendees or the graduation job:
    This is a constraint that states that Herbert's event is either the event with 50 attendees or the graduation event, but not both. So:

### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Bmangeris == 1, and Genes750 == 1, and DrOrtiz == 1, then B. mangeris was sequenced by Dr. Ortiz and has 750 genes.

Opie Oliver's card came out in 2012.
The piece that sold for $175 came out in 1999.
Of the 2012 card and the 1987 item, one featured Mike Morales and the other sold for $275.
Neddy Norris's item sold for 50 dollars more than the 1987 card.

Entities:

players: Finn Freeman, Mike Morales, Neddy Norris, Opie Oliver
years: 1974, 1987, 1999, 2012
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if OpieOliver == 1, and Price175 == 1, and Year2012 == 1, then Opie Oliver's card came out in 2012 and sold for $175.

### Decision variables:

### Constraints:

    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    OpieOliver == Year2012.

-   The piece that sold for $175 came out in 1999:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Price175 == Year1999.

-   Of the 2012 card and the 1987 item, one featured Mike Morales and the other sold for $275:
    This is a constraint that states that for the 2012 card and the 1987 item, one featured Mike Morales and the other sold for $275, but not both. So:
    Xor([
        (Year2012 == MikeMorales, Price275 == Year1987),
        (Year1987 == MikeMorales, Price275 == Year2012)
    ]).

-   Neddy Norris's item sold for 50 dollars more than the 1987 card:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the prices for Neddy Norris's item and the 1987 card, such that Neddy Norris's item price is 50 dollars more than the 1987 card's price. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == NeddyNorris and p2 == Price175 => p1_to_int == p2_to_int + 50, for all p1, p2 in prices.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if OpieOliver == 1, and Price175 == 1, and Year2012 == 1, then Opie Oliver's card came out in 2012 and sold for $175.

    This is a constraint that states that for the 2012 card and the 1987 item, one featured Mike Morales and the other sold for $275, but not both. So:
    Xor([

-   Neddy Norris's item sold for 50 dollars more than the 1987 card:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the prices for Neddy Norris's item and the 1987 card, such that Neddy Norris's item price is 50 dollars more than the 1987 card's price. So, the constraints will be of the form:

Of Nelson and the cook who scored 63 points, one made the lemon snapper and the other made the cajun chili.
Of the chef who scored 42 points and the cook who scored 63 points, one made the cashew tofu and the other was Rosalie.
Karl scored 7 more points than the person who made the lemon snapper.

Entities:
scores: 42, 49, 56, 63
chefs: Karl, Nelson, Peggy, Rosalie
dishes: cajun chili, cashew tofu, lemon snapper, smoked pork
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Karl == 1, and 42 == 1, and CajunChili == 1, then Karl scored 42 points and made the cajun chili.

### Decision variables:

        (Score42 == Rosalie, Score63 == CashewTofu)
    ]).

-   Karl scored 7 more points than the person who made the lemon snapper:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of scores for Karl and the person who made the lemon snapper, such that Karl's score is 7 more than the lemon snapper maker's score. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    s1 == Karl and s2 == LemonSnapper => s1_to_int == s2_to_int + 7, for all s1, s2 in scores.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Karl == 1, and 42 == 1, and CajunChili == 1, then Karl scored 42 points and made the cajun chili.

Clues:
Alejandro's purchase cost less than Irma's purchase.
The insect that sold for $90 was either the atlas butterfly or the emperor butterfly.
The peacock butterfly cost more than Irma's purchase.
Of Alejandro's purchase and Irma's purchase, one was the emperor butterfly and the other sold for $45.
The four butterflies were Phillip's purchase, the insect that sold for $60, the butterfly that sold for $45 and the butterfly that sold for $90.

Entities:
prices: $45, $60, $75, $90
winners: Alejandro, Faye, Irma, Phillip
butterflies: atlas, emperor, grayling, peacock
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Alejandro == 1, and $45 == 1, and atlas == 1, then Alejandro bought the atlas butterfly for $45.

### Decision variables:

-   Types of butterflies: Atlas, Emperor, Grayling, Peacock (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   Alejandro's purchase cost less than Irma's purchase:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of prices for Alejandro's and Irma's purchases, such that Alejandro's purchase cost is less than Irma's purchase cost. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Alejandro and p2 == Irma => p1_to_int < p2_to_int, for all p1, p2 in prices.

-   The insect that sold for $90 was either the atlas butterfly or the emperor butterfly:
    This is a constraint that states that the butterfly that sold for $90 is either the atlas butterfly or the emperor butterfly, but not both. So:

-   The peacock butterfly cost more than Irma's purchase:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of prices for the peacock butterfly and Irma's purchase, such that the peacock butterfly's cost is more than Irma's purchase cost. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Peacock and p2 == Irma => p1_to_int > p2_to_int, for all p1, p2 in prices.

-   Of Alejandro's purchase and Irma's purchase, one was the emperor butterfly and the other sold for $45:
    This is a constraint that states that one of Alejandro's purchase and Irma's purchase was the emperor butterfly and the other sold for $45. So:
    (Alejandro == Emperor and Irma == Price45) or (Alejandro == Price45 and Irma == Emperor).

-   The four butterflies were Phillip's purchase, the insect that sold for $60, the butterfly that sold for $45, and the butterfly that sold for $90:

start points: Bodega Bay, Cayucos, Pescadero, Pismo Beach
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Antonio == 1, and 184days == 1, and BodegaBay == 1, then Antonio traveled for 184 days starting from Bodega Bay.

    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Duration195 == Pescadero.

-   Of Dana and the athlete who traveled for 184 days, one started from Cayucos and the other started from Bodega Bay:
    This is a constraint that states that Dana and the athlete who traveled for 184 days started from different places. So:

    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Duration217 == Hilda.

-   Walter finished 11 days before the athlete who started from Cayucos:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the durations for Walter and the athlete who started from Cayucos, such that Walter's duration is 11 days less. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    d1 == Walter and d2 == Cayucos => d1_to_int + 11 == d2_to_int, for all d1, d2 in durations.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing.

-   Of Dana and the athlete who traveled for 184 days, one started from Cayucos and the other started from Bodega Bay:
    This is a constraint that states that Dana and the athlete who traveled for 184 days started from different places. So:
    Xor([
        (Dana == Cayucos, Duration184 == BodegaBay),
        (Dana == BodegaBay, Duration184 == Cayucos)

-   Hilda finished in 217 days:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Duration217 == Hilda.

-   Walter finished 11 days before the athlete who started from Cayucos:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the durations for Walter and the athlete who started from Cayucos, such that Walter's duration is 11 days less. So, the constraints will be of the form:

Entities:
earnings: 2 million, 5 million, 8 million, 11 million
movies: Amerigo, Fast and Dead, Let Me Out, What a World
directors: Jim Johnson, Kenneth Key, Linda Lynch, Micah Moreno
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same quartet. For example, if Amerigo == 1, and 2 million == 1, and JimJohnson == 1, then Amerigo made 2 million and was directed by Jim Johnson.

### Decision variables:

-   Directors of the movies: JimJohnson, KennethKey, LindaLynch, MicahMoreno (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The movie that grossed 5 million was directed by Kenneth Key:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Earnings5M == KennethKey.

-   Of What a World and Amerigo, one made 2 million and the other was directed by Jim Johnson:
    This is a constraint that states that one movie made 2 million and the other was directed by Jim Johnson, but not both. So:
    Xor([WhatAWorld == Earnings2M, WhatAWorld == JimJohnson]).

-   The film directed by Kenneth Key made 3 million less than Amerigo:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the earnings for the film directed by Kenneth Key and Amerigo, such that the film directed by Kenneth Key made 3 million less than Amerigo. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    e1 == KennethKey and e2 == Amerigo => e1_to_int == e2_to_int - 3, for all e1, e2 in earnings.

-   Fast and Dead was directed by Kenneth Key:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    FastAndDead == KennethKey.

    This is a constraint that states that Let Me Out is either directed by Linda Lynch or grossed 5 million, but not both. So:
    Xor([LetMeOut == LindaLynch, LetMeOut == Earnings5M]).
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same quartet. For example, if Amerigo == 1, and 2 million == 1, and JimJohnson == 1, then Amerigo made 2 million and was directed by Jim Johnson.

### Decision variables:
-   Earnings of the movies: Earnings2M, Earnings5M, Earnings8M, Earnings11M (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Names of the movies: Amerigo, FastAndDead, LetMeOut, WhatAWorld (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Directors of the movies: JimJohnson, KennethKey, LindaLynch, MicahMoreno (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The movie that grossed 5 million was directed by Kenneth Key:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Earnings5M == KennethKey.

-   Of What a World and Amerigo, one made 2 million and the other was directed by Jim Johnson:
    This is a constraint that states that one movie made 2 million and the other was directed by Jim Johnson, but not both. So:
    Xor([WhatAWorld == Earnings2M, WhatAWorld == JimJohnson]).

-   The film directed by Kenneth Key made 3 million less than Amerigo:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the earnings for the film directed by Kenneth Key and Amerigo, such that the film directed by Kenneth Key made 3 million less than Amerigo. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    e1 == KennethKey and e2 == Amerigo => e1_to_int == e2_to_int - 3, for all e1, e2 in earnings.

-   Fast and Dead was directed by Kenneth Key:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    FastAndDead == KennethKey.

-   Let Me Out is either the movie directed by Linda Lynch or the movie that grossed 5 million:
    This is a constraint that states that Let Me Out is either directed by Linda Lynch or grossed 5 million, but not both. So:
    Xor([LetMeOut == LindaLynch, LetMeOut == Earnings5M]).

Clues:
The person who is 110 years old is a native of Connecticut.
Of Arlene and the Texas native, one is 110 years old and the other is 109 years old.
Herbert is 1 year younger than Doris.
The person who is 112 years old is either Herbert or the New Mexico native.

Entities:
ages: 109 years, 110 years, 111 years, 112 years
names: Arlene, Doris, Floyd, Herbert
states: Connecticut, Missouri, New Mexico, Texas
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Arlene == 1, and Age109 == 1, and Connecticut == 1, then Arlene is 109 years old and is a native of Connecticut.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the people: Arlene, Doris, Floyd, Herbert (all different, 1 to 4)

-   States of origin: Connecticut, Missouri, New Mexico, Texas (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The person who is 110 years old is a native of Connecticut:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Age110 == Connecticut.

-   Of Arlene and the Texas native, one is 110 years old and the other is 109 years old:
    This is a constraint that states that one of Arlene and the Texas native is 110 years old and the other is 109 years old. So, we can represent this as:
    (Arlene == Age110 and Texas == Age109) or (Arlene == Age109 and Texas == Age110).

-   Herbert is 1 year younger than Doris:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of ages for Herbert and Doris, such that Herbert's age is 1 year younger than Doris's age. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    a1 == Herbert and a2 == Doris => a1_to_int == a2_to_int - 1, for all a1, a2 in ages.

-   The person who is 112 years old is either Herbert or the New Mexico native:
    This is a constraint that states that the person who is 112 years old is either Herbert or the New Mexico native. So, we can represent this as:
    (Herbert == Age112) or (NewMexico == Age112).
### Plan:

    This is a constraint that states that one of Arlene and the Texas native is 110 years old and the other is 109 years old. So, we can represent this as:
    (Arlene == Age110 and Texas == Age109) or (Arlene == Age109 and Texas == Age110).

-   Herbert is 1 year younger than Doris:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of ages for Herbert and Doris, such that Herbert's age is 1 year younger than Doris's age. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    a1 == Herbert and a2 == Doris => a1_to_int == a2_to_int - 1, for all a1, a2 in ages.

    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the prices for Grand Echo and Emerald View, such that Grand Echo's price is 20 dollars less than Emerald View's price. So, the constraints will be of the form:

Clues:
Snappy is 18 years younger than the swoopbacked tortoise.
The 68 year old animal is the horned tortoise.
Chewie is 32 years old.
Of Snappy and Toredo, one is 14 years old and the other is the horned tortoise.
The pitch belly tortoise is younger than Chewie.

Entities:
ages: 14, 32, 50, 68
tortoises: Chewie, Snappy, Speedy, Toredo
species: black neck, horned, pitch belly, swoopbacked
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Chewie == 1, and Age32 == 1, and BlackNeck == 1, then Chewie is 32 years old and is a black neck tortoise.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the tortoises: Chewie, Snappy, Speedy, Toredo (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Ages of the tortoises: Age14, Age32, Age50, Age68 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Species of the tortoises: BlackNeck, Horned, PitchBelly, Swoopbacked (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   Snappy is 18 years younger than the swoopbacked tortoise:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the ages for Snappy and the swoopbacked tortoise, such that Snappy's age is 18 years less than the swoopbacked tortoise's age. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    a1 == Snappy and a2 == Swoopbacked => a1_to_int == a2_to_int - 18, for all a1, a2 in ages.

-   The 68 year old animal is the horned tortoise:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Age68 == Horned.

-   Chewie is 32 years old:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Chewie == Age32.

-   Of Snappy and Toredo, one is 14 years old and the other is the horned tortoise:
    This is a constraint that states that for Snappy and Toredo, one is 14 years old and the other is the horned tortoise, but not both. So:
    Xor([
        (Snappy == Age14, Toredo == Horned),
        (Snappy == Horned, Toredo == Age14)
    ]).

-   The pitch belly tortoise is younger than Chewie:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the ages for the pitch belly tortoise and Chewie, such that the pitch belly tortoise's age is less than Chewie's age. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    a1 == PitchBelly and a2 == Chewie => a1_to_int < a2_to_int, for all a1, a2 in ages.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Chewie == 1, and Age32 == 1, and BlackNeck == 1, then Chewie is 32 years old and is a black neck tortoise.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the tortoises: Chewie, Snappy, Speedy, Toredo (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Ages of the tortoises: Age14, Age32, Age50, Age68 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Species of the tortoises: BlackNeck, Horned, PitchBelly, Swoopbacked (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:

    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the ages for Snappy and the swoopbacked tortoise, such that Snappy's age is 18 years less than the swoopbacked tortoise's age. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    a1 == Snappy and a2 == Swoopbacked => a1_to_int == a2_to_int - 18, for all a1, a2 in ages.

-   The 68 year old animal is the horned tortoise:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Age68 == Horned.

-   Chewie is 32 years old:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Chewie == Age32.

-   Of Snappy and Toredo, one is 14 years old and the other is the horned tortoise:
    This is a constraint that states that for Snappy and Toredo, one is 14 years old and the other is the horned tortoise, but not both. So:
    Xor([
        (Snappy == Age14, Toredo == Horned),
        (Snappy == Horned, Toredo == Age14)
    ]).

-   The pitch belly tortoise is younger than Chewie:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the ages for the pitch belly tortoise and Chewie, such that the pitch belly tortoise's age is less than Chewie's age. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    a1 == PitchBelly and a2 == Chewie => a1_to_int < a2_to_int, for all a1, a2 in ages.

Clues:
Of the parrot and the lorikeet, one was bought in April and the other is Roberta's.
Natalie's pet was bought sometime before Roberta's pet.
Laura's pet is the lovebird.
The bird bought in February is either the lorikeet or the lovebird.
Of the bird bought in February and the macaw, one is Natalie's and the other is Roberta's.

Entities:
months: January, February, March, April
names: Celia, Laura, Natalie, Roberta
birds: lorikeet, lovebird, macaw, parrot
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Celia == 1, and January == 1, and Lorikeet == 1, then Celia bought the lorikeet in January.

### Decision variables:

-   Months of purchase: January, February, March, April (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Types of birds: Lorikeet, Lovebird, Macaw, Parrot (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   Of the parrot and the lorikeet, one was bought in April and the other is Roberta's:
    This is a constraint that states that one of the birds (parrot or lorikeet) was bought in April and the other bird is Roberta's. So:

-   Natalie's pet was bought sometime before Roberta's pet:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months for Natalie's pet and Roberta's pet, such that Natalie's pet was bought before Roberta's pet. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == Natalie and m2 == Roberta => m1_to_int < m2_to_int, for all m1, m2 in months.

-   Laura's pet is the lovebird:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Laura == Lovebird.

-   The bird bought in February is either the lorikeet or the lovebird:
    This is a constraint that states that the bird bought in February is either the lorikeet or the lovebird, but not both. So:
    Xor([February == Lorikeet, February == Lovebird]).

-   Of the bird bought in February and the macaw, one is Natalie's and the other is Roberta's:
    This is a constraint that states that one of the birds (bird bought in February or macaw) is Natalie's and the other is Roberta's. So:
    Xor([

Masseuses: Lynda, Nancy, Teri, Whitney
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Aimee == 1, and Price150 == 1, and Lynda == 1, then Aimee paid $150 to Lynda.

-   Masseuses: Lynda, Nancy, Teri, Whitney (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   Hannah paid more than Teri's client:
    For each possible assignment of prices to Hannah and Teri's client, ensure that Hannah's price is greater than Teri's client's price:
    For all prices p1, p2: if Hannah == p1 and Teri == p2, then p1 > p2.

-   Freda paid 20 dollars more than Lynda's client:
    For each possible assignment of prices to Freda and Lynda's client, ensure that Freda's price is $20 more than Lynda's client's price:

-   Hannah paid 10 dollars less than Nancy's client:
    For each possible assignment of prices to Hannah and Nancy's client, ensure that Hannah's price is $10 less than Nancy's client's price:

    Ensure that Nancy, Hannah, and Ginger are all different clients:
    AllDifferent([Nancy, Hannah, Ginger]).

Clues:
The 115 ft tall waterfall is either the waterfall in Nigeria or the waterfall located in Tibet.
Inawatai is 100 ft tall.
Nyalt is 10 ft taller than Rhoqua.
The waterfall in Brazil is somewhat shorter than Rhoqua.
The waterfall in Brazil is 10 ft shorter than the waterfall located in Nigeria.

Entities:
waterfalls: Sihat, Rhoqua, Nyalt, Inawatai
heights: 100 ft, 105 ft, 110 ft, 115 ft
countries: Brazil, Nigeria, Tibet, Switzerland
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Sihat == 1, and 100ft == 1, and Brazil == 1, then Sihat is the 100 ft tall waterfall located in Brazil.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the waterfalls: Sihat, Rhoqua, Nyalt, Inawatai (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Heights of the waterfalls: Height100, Height105, Height110, Height115 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Countries of the waterfalls: Brazil, Nigeria, Tibet, Switzerland (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The 115 ft tall waterfall is either the waterfall in Nigeria or the waterfall located in Tibet:
    This is a constraint that states that the 115 ft tall waterfall's country is either Nigeria or Tibet. So:
    Xor([Height115 == Nigeria, Height115 == Tibet]).

-   Inawatai is 100 ft tall:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Inawatai == Height100.

-   Nyalt is 10 ft taller than Rhoqua:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the heights for Nyalt and Rhoqua, such that Nyalt's height is 10 ft taller than Rhoqua's height. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    h1 == Nyalt and h2 == Rhoqua => h1_to_int == h2_to_int + 10, for all h1, h2 in heights.

-   The waterfall in Brazil is somewhat shorter than Rhoqua:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the heights for the waterfall in Brazil and Rhoqua, such that the waterfall in Brazil's height is less than Rhoqua's height. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    h1 == Brazil and h2 == Rhoqua => h1_to_int < h2_to_int, for all h1, h2 in heights.

-   The waterfall in Brazil is 10 ft shorter than the waterfall located in Nigeria:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the heights for the waterfall in Brazil and the waterfall in Nigeria, such that the waterfall in Brazil's height is 10 ft shorter than the waterfall in Nigeria's height. So, the constraints will be of the form:

-   Inawatai is 100 ft tall:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Inawatai == Height100.

-   Nyalt is 10 ft taller than Rhoqua:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the heights for Nyalt and Rhoqua, such that Nyalt's height is 10 ft taller than Rhoqua's height. So, the constraints will be of the form:

The player who played third base played 2 more games than the person who played center field.
Charles played 2 more games than the player who played center field.
Charles was either the boy who played 9 games or the person who played 10 games.

Entities:
players: Charles, Evan, Karl, Vincent
games: 8, 9, 10, 11
positions: center field, first base, shortstop, third base
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Charles == 1, and Games9 == 1, and ThirdBase == 1, then Charles played 9 games and played third base.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the players: Charles, Evan, Karl, Vincent (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Number of games played: Games8, Games9, Games10, Games11 (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   Evan played 9 games:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:

-   Vincent played first base:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Vincent == FirstBase.

-   The player who played third base played 2 more games than the person who played center field:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the number of games for the player who played third base and the player who played center field, such that the third base player's games are 2 more than the center field player's games. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    g1 == ThirdBase and g2 == CenterField => g1_to_int == g2_to_int + 2, for all g1, g2 in games.

-   Charles played 2 more games than the player who played center field:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the number of games for Charles and the player who played center field, such that Charles's games are 2 more than the center field player's games. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    g1 == Charles and g2 == CenterField => g1_to_int == g2_to_int + 2, for all g1, g2 in games.

-   Charles was either the boy who played 9 games or the person who played 10 games:
    This is a constraint that states that Charles's number of games is either 9 or 10, but not both. So:

### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Charles == 1, and Games9 == 1, and ThirdBase == 1, then Charles played 9 games and played third base.

So, the constraints will be of the form:

The diner who paid $5 was either the one who got the cream soda or the one who got the iced tea.
The four diners were the diner who paid $5, the one who got the iced tea, the one who got the root beer and Irene.

Entities:

prices: $4, $5, $6, $7
drinks: cream soda, iced tea, root beer, water
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Angela == 1, and Price4 == 1, and IcedTea == 1, then Angela paid $4 for the iced tea.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the diners: Angela, Edmund, Homer, Irene (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Prices paid by the diners: Price4, Price5, Price6, Price7 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Drinks ordered by the diners: CreamSoda, IcedTea, RootBeer, Water (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   Edmund paid 1 dollar less than the one who got the water:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the prices for Edmund and the one who got the water, such that Edmund's price is 1 dollar less than the price for water. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Edmund and p2 == Water => p1_to_int == p2_to_int - 1, for all p1, p2 in prices.

-   The diner who paid $4 had the iced tea:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:

-   Angela paid more than the one who got the cream soda:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the prices for Angela and the one who got the cream soda, such that Angela's price is greater than the price for cream soda. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Angela and p2 == CreamSoda => p1_to_int > p2_to_int, for all p1, p2 in prices.

-   The diner who paid $5 was either the one who got the cream soda or the one who got the iced tea:
    This is a constraint that states that the diner who paid $5's drink is either cream soda or iced tea, but not both. So:
    Xor([Price5 == CreamSoda, Price5 == IcedTea]).

-   The four diners were the diner who paid $5, the one who got the iced tea, the one who got the root beer, and Irene:
    This is a constraint that states that all these entities are different, thus:

### Plan:

-   Ingram had 7 goals this season:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Ingram == Goals7.

-   The four players are Underwood, the player from the Ice Hogs, the player from the Monsters, and the player from the Checkers:
    This is a constraint that states that all these entities are different, thus:
    AllDifferent([Underwood, IceHogs, Monsters, Checkers]).

-   Parrish scored 1 goal more than Quinn:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the number of goals for Parrish and Quinn, such that Parrish's number of goals is 1 more than Quinn's number of goals. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    g1 == Parrish and g2 == Quinn => g1_to_int == g2_to_int + 1, for all g1, g2 in goals.

-   The player with 9 goals is from the Ice Hogs:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Goals9 == IceHogs.

-   Ingram is either the player from the Checkers or the player with 6 goals:
    This is a constraint that states that Ingram's team is either the Checkers or Ingram's number of goals is 6, but not both. So:
    Xor([Ingram == Checkers, Ingram == Goals6]).
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Ingram == 1, and Goals7 == 1, and Checkers == 1, then Ingram scored 7 goals this season and is from the Checkers.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the players: Ingram, Parrish, Quinn, Underwood (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Number of goals scored: Goals6, Goals7, Goals8, Goals9 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Names of the teams: Checkers, Comets, IceHogs, Monsters (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   Ingram had 7 goals this season:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Ingram == Goals7.

    g1 == Parrish and g2 == Quinn => g1_to_int == g2_to_int + 1, for all g1, g2 in goals.

-   The player with 9 goals is from the Ice Hogs:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Goals9 == IceHogs.

-   Ingram is either the player from the Checkers or the player with 6 goals:
    This is a constraint that states that Ingram's team is either the Checkers or Ingram's number of goals is 6, but not both. So:

Clues:
Jorge is either the skydiver who wears the red suit or the jumper who started in 1982.
The skydiver who wears the pink suit started skydiving 1 year before Otis.
The jumper who wears the yellow suit started skydiving sometime after Philip.
The jumper who wears the lime green suit started skydiving sometime after the jumper who wears the yellow suit.
The jumper who wears the pink suit started skydiving 2 years before Shaun.

Entities:
names: Jorge, Otis, Philip, Shaun
years: 1982, 1983, 1984, 1985
suit colors: lime green, pink, red, yellow
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Jorge == 1, and Year1982 == 1, and Red == 1, then Jorge is the skydiver who started in 1982 and wears the red suit.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the skydivers: Jorge, Otis, Philip, Shaun (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Start years of skydiving: Year1982, Year1983, Year1984, Year1985 (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   Jorge is either the skydiver who wears the red suit or the jumper who started in 1982:
    This is a constraint that states that Jorge's suit color is either red or Jorge's start year is 1982, but not both. So:
    Xor([Jorge == Red, Jorge == Year1982]).

-   The skydiver who wears the pink suit started skydiving 1 year before Otis:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the start years for the skydiver who wears the pink suit and Otis, such that the pink suit's start year is 1 year before Otis's start year. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    y1 == Pink and y2 == Otis => y1_to_int == y2_to_int - 1, for all y1, y2 in start years.

-   The jumper who wears the yellow suit started skydiving sometime after Philip:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the start years for the jumper who wears the yellow suit and Philip, such that the yellow suit's start year is after Philip's start year. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    y1 == Yellow and y2 == Philip => y1_to_int > y2_to_int, for all y1, y2 in start years.

-   The jumper who wears the lime green suit started skydiving sometime after the jumper who wears the yellow suit:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the start years for the jumper who wears the lime green suit and the jumper who wears the yellow suit, such that the lime green suit's start year is after the yellow suit's start year. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    y1 == LimeGreen and y2 == Yellow => y1_to_int > y2_to_int, for all y1, y2 in start years.

-   The jumper who wears the pink suit started skydiving 2 years before Shaun:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the start years for the jumper who wears the pink suit and Shaun, such that the pink suit's start year is 2 years before Shaun's start year. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    y1 == Pink and y2 == Shaun => y1_to_int == y2_to_int - 2, for all y1, y2 in start years.

Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing.

    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the start years for the jumper who wears the yellow suit and Philip, such that the yellow suit's start year is after Philip's start year. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    y1 == Yellow and y2 == Philip => y1_to_int > y2_to_int, for all y1, y2 in start years.

    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the start years for the jumper who wears the lime green suit and the jumper who wears the yellow suit, such that the lime green suit's start year is after the yellow suit's start year.

Entities:
teas: Ali Shan, Jin Xuan, Pouchong, Red Robe
prices: $4, $5, $6, $7

### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if AliShan == 1, and $4 == 1, and Temp190 == 1, then Ali Shan costs $4 and requires 190 degree water.

-   The Pouchong costs 1 dollar less than the Red Robe:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the prices for Pouchong and Red Robe, such that Pouchong costs 1 dollar less than Red Robe. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Pouchong and p2 == RedRobe => p1_to_int == p2_to_int - 1, for all p1, p2 in prices.

-   Ronda's sandwich and the sandwich with havarti cheese are different sandwiches:
    This is a constraint that states that Ronda's sandwich is not the one with havarti cheese. So:
    Ronda != Havarti.

-   Ronda's order costs $5:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Ronda == Price5.

-   Lula's order is either the $3 sandwich or the order that costs $5:
    This is a constraint that states that Lula's order is either $3 or $5, but not both. So:
    Xor([Lula == Price3, Lula == Price5]).

-   The sandwich with cheddar cheese costs less than the order with havarti cheese:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the prices for cheddar and havarti cheese, such that the cheddar cheese order costs less than the havarti cheese order. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Cheddar and p2 == Havarti => p1_to_int < p2_to_int, for all p1, p2 in prices.

-   Yolanda's sandwich costs $2 less than the order with swiss cheese:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the prices for Yolanda's sandwich and the swiss cheese order, such that Yolanda's sandwich costs $2 less than the swiss cheese order. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Yolanda and p2 == Swiss => p1_to_int == p2_to_int - 2, for all p1, p2 in prices.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same quartet. For example, if Lula == 1, and $3 == 1, and Cheddar == 1, then Lula's order is the $3 sandwich with cheddar cheese.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the customers: Lula, Ronda, Sue, Yolanda (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Prices of the orders: Price2, Price3, Price4, Price5 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Types of cheeses: Cheddar, Havarti, Muenster, Swiss (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:

-   The rocket developed by SpaceZen will launch sometime after the Beritron:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months of launch for the SpaceZen rocket and the Beritron, such that SpaceZen's rocket's month of launch is after Beritron's month of launch. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == SpaceZen and m2 == Beritron => m1_to_int > m2_to_int, for all m1, m2 in months of launch.

-   The Worul is made by Techtrin:

### Constraints:
-   The student who will major in Physics was awarded $5000 less than the student who will major in Biology:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of scholarships for the Physics and Biology majors, such that the Physics major's scholarship amount is $5000 less than the Biology major's scholarship amount. So, the constraints will be of the form:

Clues:
The ambassador with the 9 day visit will leave sometime after Fitzgerald.
Quinn will leave 2 months after Bender.
The person leaving in January is either the ambassador with the 3 day visit or Fitzgerald.
Quinn will leave 1 month before the ambassador with the 7 day visit.

Entities:
diplomats: Bender, Fitzgerald, Owens, Quinn
months: January, February, March, April
durations: 2 day, 3 day, 7 day, 9 day
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Bender == 1, and January == 1, and Day2 == 1, then Bender is the diplomat leaving in January with a 2-day visit.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the diplomats: Bender, Fitzgerald, Owens, Quinn (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Months of departure: January, February, March, April (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Durations of visit: Day2, Day3, Day7, Day9 (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The ambassador with the 9-day visit will leave sometime after Fitzgerald:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months of departure for the ambassador with the 9-day visit and Fitzgerald, such that the ambassador with the 9-day visit's month of departure is greater than Fitzgerald's month of departure. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == Day9 and m2 == Fitzgerald => m1_to_int > m2_to_int, for all m1, m2 in months of departure.

-   Quinn will leave 2 months after Bender:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months of departure for Quinn and Bender, such that Quinn's month of departure is 2 months after Bender's month of departure. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == Quinn and m2 == Bender => m1_to_int == m2_to_int + 2, for all m1, m2 in months of departure.

-   The person leaving in January is either the ambassador with the 3-day visit or Fitzgerald:
    This is a constraint that states that the person leaving in January is either the ambassador with the 3-day visit or Fitzgerald, but not both. So:
    Xor([January == Day3, January == Fitzgerald]).

-   Quinn will leave 1 month before the ambassador with the 7-day visit:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months of departure for Quinn and the ambassador with the 7-day visit, such that Quinn's month of departure is 1 month before the ambassador with the 7-day visit. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == Quinn and m2 == Day7 => m1_to_int == m2_to_int - 1, for all m1, m2 in months of departure.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet.

    m1 == Day9 and m2 == Fitzgerald => m1_to_int > m2_to_int, for all m1, m2 in months of departure.

-   Quinn will leave 2 months after Bender:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months of departure for Quinn and Bender, such that Quinn's month of departure is 2 months after Bender's month of departure. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == Quinn and m2 == Bender => m1_to_int == m2_to_int + 2, for all m1, m2 in months of departure.

-   The person leaving in January is either the ambassador with the 3-day visit or Fitzgerald:
    This is a constraint that states that the person leaving in January is either the ambassador with the 3-day visit or Fitzgerald, but not both. So:
    Xor([January == Day3, January == Fitzgerald]).

-   Quinn will leave 1 month before the ambassador with the 7-day visit:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months of departure for Quinn and the ambassador with the 7-day visit, such that Quinn's month of departure is 1 month before the ambassador with the 7-day visit. So, the constraints will be of the form:

Clues:
The person who came in at 8:00am asked for wheat bread.
Tricia came in a half-hour after Ora.
Of Felicia and the customer who ordered flatbread, one came in at 7:30am and the other came in at 7:00am.
Of the customer who ordered wheat bread; and the person who ordered pumpernickel, one came in at 8:30am and the other was Tricia.

Entities:
breads: flatbread, pumpernickel, rye bread, wheat bread
times: 7:00am, 7:30am, 8:00am, 8:30am
customers: Felicia, Isabel, Ora, Tricia
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Felicia == 1, and WheatBread == 1, and Time800 == 1, then Felicia came in at 8:00am and ordered wheat bread.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the customers: Felicia, Isabel, Ora, Tricia (all different, 1 to 4)

-   Times of arrival: Time700, Time730, Time800, Time830 (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The person who came in at 8:00am asked for wheat bread:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:

-   Tricia came in a half-hour after Ora:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of times for Tricia and Ora, such that Tricia came in a half-hour after Ora. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    t1 == Tricia and t2 == Ora => t1_to_int == t2_to_int + 1, for all t1, t2 in times.

-   Of Felicia and the customer who ordered flatbread, one came in at 7:30am and the other came in at 7:00am:
    This is a constraint that states that Felicia and the customer who ordered flatbread came in at different times, one at 7:30am and the other at 7:00am. So:
    Xor([Felicia == Time730, Felicia == Flatbread], [Flatbread == Time730, Felicia == Flatbread]).

-   Of the customer who ordered wheat bread and the person who ordered pumpernickel, one came in at 8:30am and the other was Tricia:
    This is a constraint that states that the customer who ordered wheat bread and the person who ordered pumpernickel came in at different times, one at 8:30am and the other was Tricia. So:
    Xor([WheatBread == Time830, WheatBread == Tricia], [Pumpernickel == Time830, Pumpernickel == Tricia]).
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Felicia == 1, and WheatBread == 1, and Time800 == 1, then Felicia came in at 8:00am and ordered wheat bread.

-   Of Felicia and the customer who ordered flatbread, one came in at 7:30am and the other came in at 7:00am:
    This is a constraint that states that Felicia and the customer who ordered flatbread came in at different times, one at 7:30am and the other at 7:00am. So:
    Xor([Felicia == Time730, Felicia == Flatbread], [Flatbread == Time730, Felicia == Flatbread]).

The senosaurus is 85 million years old.
The 75 million year old fossil costs 500 dollars less than the 78 million year old fossil.
The 75 million year old fossil costs less than the archadon.
The 69 million year old fossil costs 250 dollars more than the 78 million year old fossil.

price: $500, $750, $1000, $1250
ages: 69 million, 75 million, 78 million, 85 million
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Archadon == 1, and Price500 == 1, and Age69 == 1, then Archadon is the dinosaur with a price of $500 and an age of 69 million years.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the dinosaurs: Archadon, Mirasaurus, Pilodontus, Senosaurus (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The 75 million year old fossil costs 500 dollars less than the pilodontus:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the prices for the 75 million year old fossil and the pilodontus, such that the 75 million year old fossil's price is 500 dollars less than the pilodontus' price. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == 75 million year old fossil and p2 == Pilodontus => p1_to_int == p2_to_int - 500, for all p1, p2 in prices.

-   The senosaurus is 85 million years old:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Senosaurus == Age85.

-   The 75 million year old fossil costs 500 dollars less than the 78 million year old fossil:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the prices for the 75 million year old fossil and the 78 million year old fossil, such that the 75 million year old fossil's price is 500 dollars less than the 78 million year old fossil's price.

    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the prices for the 75 million year old fossil and the archadon, such that the 75 million year old fossil's price is less than the archadon's price. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == 75 million year old fossil and p2 == Archadon => p1_to_int < p2_to_int, for all p1, p2 in prices.

-   The 69 million year old fossil costs 250 dollars more than the 78 million year old fossil:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the prices for the 69 million year old fossil and the 78 million year old fossil, such that the 69 million year old fossil's price is 250 dollars more than the 78 million year old fossil's price. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == 69 million year old fossil and p2 == 78 million year old fossil => p1_to_int == p2_to_int + 250, for all p1, p2 in prices.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Archadon == 1, and Price500 == 1, and Age69 == 1, then Archadon is the dinosaur with a price of $500 and an age of 69 million years.

-   The 75 million year old fossil costs 500 dollars less than the 78 million year old fossil:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the prices for the 75 million year old fossil and the 78 million year old fossil, such that the 75 million year old fossil's price is 500 dollars less than the 78 million year old fossil's price.

Clues:
Henrietta's task starts 2 hours after Glenn's job.
Glenn's task is the dining room.

Henrietta's task is the living room.
The mud room assignment starts sometime before Willie's assignment.

Entities:
children: Glenn, Henrietta, Olivia, Willie
times: 8:00am, 9:00am, 10:00am, 11:00am
rooms: dining room, laundry room, living room, mud room
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same quartet. For example, if Glenn == 1, and Time8am == 1, and DiningRoom == 1, then Glenn's task starts at 8:00 am in the dining room.

### Decision variables:

-   Rooms for the tasks: DiningRoom, LaundryRoom, LivingRoom, MudRoom (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   Henrietta's task starts 2 hours after Glenn's job:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of times for Henrietta and Glenn's tasks, such that Henrietta's task starts 2 hours after Glenn's task. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    t1 == Henrietta and t2 == Glenn => t1_to_int == t2_to_int + 2, for all t1, t2 in times.

-   Glenn's task is the dining room:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Glenn == DiningRoom.

-   Glenn's chore starts 1 hour after the mud room assignment:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of times for Glenn's task and the mud room assignment, such that Glenn's task starts 1 hour after the mud room assignment. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    t1 == Glenn and t2 == MudRoom => t1_to_int == t2_to_int + 1, for all t1, t2 in times.

-   Henrietta's task is the living room:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Henrietta == LivingRoom.

-   The mud room assignment starts sometime before Willie's assignment:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of times for the mud room assignment and Willie's task, such that the mud room assignment starts before Willie's task. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    t1 == MudRoom and t2 == Willie => t1_to_int < t2_to_int, for all t1, t2 in times.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same quartet. For example, if Glenn == 1, and Time8am == 1, and DiningRoom == 1, then Glenn's task starts at 8:00 am in the dining room.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the children: Glenn, Henrietta, Olivia, Willie (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Times of the tasks: Time8am, Time9am, Time10am, Time11am (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Rooms for the tasks: DiningRoom, LaundryRoom, LivingRoom, MudRoom (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   Henrietta's task starts 2 hours after Glenn's job:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of times for Henrietta and Glenn's tasks, such that Henrietta's task starts 2 hours after Glenn's task. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    t1 == Henrietta and t2 == Glenn => t1_to_int == t2_to_int + 2, for all t1, t2 in times.

-   Glenn's task is the dining room:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Glenn == DiningRoom.

-   Glenn's chore starts 1 hour after the mud room assignment:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of times for Glenn's task and the mud room assignment, such that Glenn's task starts 1 hour after the mud room assignment. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    t1 == Glenn and t2 == MudRoom => t1_to_int == t2_to_int + 1, for all t1, t2 in times.

-   Henrietta's task is the living room:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Henrietta == LivingRoom.

-   The mud room assignment starts sometime before Willie's assignment:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of times for the mud room assignment and Willie's task, such that the mud room assignment starts before Willie's task. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    t1 == MudRoom and t2 == Willie => t1_to_int < t2_to_int, for all t1, t2 in times.

Entities:
customers: Mr. Ayers, Mr. Drake, Mr. Erickson, Mr. Gallegos
dates: July 13, July 14, July 15, July 16
guides: Hilda, Jorge, Nadine, Vicki
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if MrAyers == 1, and July14 == 1, and Hilda == 1, then Mr. Ayers will dive on July 14 with Hilda.

    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of dates for the customer going out with Nadine and Mr. Ayers, such that the customer going out with Nadine's dive date is 1 day before Mr. Ayers's dive date. So, the constraints will be of the form:

Entities:

Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Ingram == 1, and Goals7 == 1, and Checkers == 1, then Ingram scored 7 goals this season and is from the Checkers.

-   Parrish scored 1 goal more than Quinn:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the number of goals for Parrish and Quinn, such that Parrish's number of goals is 1 more than Quinn's number of goals. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    g1 == Parrish and g2 == Quinn => g1_to_int == g2_to_int + 1, for all g1, g2 in goals.

-   The player with 9 goals is from the Ice Hogs:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Goals9 == IceHogs.

-   Ingram is either the player from the Checkers or the player with 6 goals:
    This is a constraint that states that Ingram's team is either the Checkers or Ingram's number of goals is 6, but not both. So:

### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Ingram == 1, and Goals7 == 1, and Checkers == 1, then Ingram scored 7 goals this season and is from the Checkers.

-   Parrish scored 1 goal more than Quinn:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the number of goals for Parrish and Quinn, such that Parrish's number of goals is 1 more than Quinn's number of goals. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    g1 == Parrish and g2 == Quinn => g1_to_int == g2_to_int + 1, for all g1, g2 in goals.

The study on the Liberty starts 2 months after Eunice's project.

Entities:

### Constraints:

    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the start months for Natasha's study and the project on the Odyssey, such that Natasha's study's start month is 2 months after the Odyssey's project start month. So, the constraints will be of the form:

-   Of the assignment on the Liberty and the assignment on the Escape, one is Felix's assignment and the other starts in March:
    This is a constraint that states that for the assignments on the Liberty and the Escape, one is Felix's and the other starts in March. So:
    Xor([
        (Liberty == Felix, Escape == March),
        (Liberty == March, Escape == Felix)
    ]).

-   The study on the Liberty starts 2 months after Eunice's project:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the start months for the study on the Liberty and Eunice's project, such that the study on the Liberty's start month is 2 months after Eunice's project start month. So, the constraints will be of the form:

    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the start months for the study on the Liberty and Eunice's project, such that the study on the Liberty's start month is 2 months after Eunice's project start month. So, the constraints will be of the form:

Clues:
The project headed by Dr. Golden will go online sometime before the Zynga Complex.
The project headed by Dr. Weber will go online 1 year before the Bale-Hahn SSC.
The Egert Facility will go online 1 year after the ISON-X42.
The project headed by Dr. Owens will go online 1 year after the ISON-X42.

Entities:
years: 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019
names: Bale-Hahn SSC, Egert Facility, ISON-X42, Zynga Complex
scientists: Dr. Farley, Dr. Golden, Dr. Owens, Dr. Weber
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if BaleHahnSSC == 1, and 2016 == 1, and DrFarley == 1, then the Bale-Hahn SSC project, headed by Dr. Farley, went online in 2016.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the projects: BaleHahnSSC, EgertFacility, ISONX42, ZyngaComplex (all different, 1 to 4)

-   Names of the scientists: DrFarley, DrGolden, DrOwens, DrWeber (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The project headed by Dr. Golden will go online sometime before the Zynga Complex:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the years for Dr. Golden's project and the Zynga Complex, such that Dr. Golden's project's year is less than the Zynga Complex's year. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    y1 == DrGolden and y2 == ZyngaComplex => y1_to_int < y2_to_int, for all y1, y2 in years.

-   The project headed by Dr. Weber will go online 1 year before the Bale-Hahn SSC:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the years for Dr. Weber's project and the Bale-Hahn SSC, such that Dr. Weber's project's year is 1 less than the Bale-Hahn SSC's year. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    y1 == DrWeber and y2 == BaleHahnSSC => y1_to_int == y2_to_int - 1, for all y1, y2 in years.

-   The Egert Facility will go online 1 year after the ISON-X42:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the years for the Egert Facility and the ISON-X42, such that the Egert Facility's year is 1 more than the ISON-X42's year. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    y1 == EgertFacility and y2 == ISONX42 => y1_to_int == y2_to_int + 1, for all y1, y2 in years.

    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the years for Dr. Owens's project and the ISON-X42, such that Dr. Owens's project's year is 1 more than the ISON-X42's year. So, the constraints will be of the form:

Clues:
The model made by Torvia costs 25 dollars more than the model made by Honwa.
The camera made by Honwa is either the Zenix 2C or the MX-827.
Of the $600 model and the FC-520, one is made by Honwa and the other is made by Dayero.
The Zenix 2C costs less than the FC-520.

Entities:
companies: Banion, Dayero, Honwa, Torvia
prices: $550, $575, $600, $625
cameras: DM-5000, FC-520, MX-827, Zenix 2C
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Banion == 1, and $550 == 1, and DM5000 == 1, then the model made by Banion costs $550 and is the DM-5000 camera.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the companies: Banion, Dayero, Honwa, Torvia (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Prices of the cameras: Price550, Price575, Price600, Price625 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Names of the cameras: DM5000, FC520, MX827, Zenix2C (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The model made by Torvia costs 25 dollars more than the model made by Honwa:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the prices for the model made by Torvia and the model made by Honwa, such that Torvia's model's price is 25 dollars more than Honwa's model's price. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Torvia and p2 == Honwa => p1_to_int == p2_to_int + 25, for all p1, p2 in prices.

-   The camera made by Honwa is either the Zenix 2C or the MX-827:
    This is a constraint that states that the camera made by Honwa's model is either Zenix 2C or MX-827, but not both. So:
    Xor([Honwa == Zenix2C, Honwa == MX827]).

-   Of the $600 model and the FC-520, one is made by Honwa and the other is made by Dayero:
    This is a constraint that states that for the $600 model and the FC-520, one is associated with Honwa and the other with Dayero, but not both. So:
    Xor([
        (Price600 == Honwa, FC520 == Dayero),
        (Price600 == Dayero, FC520 == Honwa)
    ]).

-   The Zenix 2C costs less than the FC-520:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the prices for the Zenix 2C and the FC-520, such that Zenix 2C's price is less than FC-520's price. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Zenix2C and p2 == FC520 => p1_to_int < p2_to_int, for all p1, p2 in prices.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Banion == 1, and $550 == 1, and DM5000 == 1, then the model made by Banion costs $550 and is the DM-5000 camera.

### Decision variables:

-   Prices of the cameras: Price550, Price575, Price600, Price625 (all different, 1 to 4)

-   The camera made by Honwa is either the Zenix 2C or the MX-827:
    This is a constraint that states that the camera made by Honwa's model is either Zenix 2C or MX-827, but not both. So:
    Xor([Honwa == Zenix2C, Honwa == MX827]).

-   Of the $600 model and the FC-520, one is made by Honwa and the other is made by Dayero:
    This is a constraint that states that for the $600 model and the FC-520, one is associated with Honwa and the other with Dayero, but not both. So:
    Xor([
        (Price600 == Honwa, FC520 == Dayero),
        (Price600 == Dayero, FC520 == Honwa)
    ]).

-   The Zenix 2C costs less than the FC-520:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the prices for the Zenix 2C and the FC-520, such that Zenix 2C's price is less than FC-520's price. So, the constraints will be of the form:

Clues:
The football facility holds more people than Underwood Arena.
The basketball facility holds 80 more people than Vazquez Arena.
Young Arena holds 230 people.
Underwood Arena holds 40 fewer people than Vazquez Arena.
The facility with seating for 190 people is either the lacrosse facility or Underwood Arena.

Entities:
arenas: Gentry, Underwood, Vazquez, Young
capacities: 110, 150, 190, 230
sports: basketball, football, lacrosse, soccer
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Gentry == 1, and 230 == 1, and Football == 1, then Gentry is the football facility with a capacity of 230 people.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the arenas: Gentry, Underwood, Vazquez, Young (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Capacities of the arenas: Capacity110, Capacity150, Capacity190, Capacity230 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Types of sports: Basketball, Football, Lacrosse, Soccer (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The football facility holds more people than Underwood Arena:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the capacities for the football facility and Underwood Arena, such that the football facility's capacity is greater than Underwood Arena's capacity. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    c1 == Football and c2 == Underwood => c1_to_int > c2_to_int, for all c1, c2 in capacities.

-   The basketball facility holds 80 more people than Vazquez Arena:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the capacities for the basketball facility and Vazquez Arena, such that the basketball facility's capacity is 80 more than Vazquez Arena's capacity. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    c1 == Basketball and c2 == Vazquez => c1_to_int == c2_to_int + 80, for all c1, c2 in capacities.

-   Young Arena holds 230 people:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Young == Capacity230.

-   Underwood Arena holds 40 fewer people than Vazquez Arena:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the capacities for Underwood Arena and Vazquez Arena, such that Underwood Arena's capacity is 40 less than Vazquez Arena's capacity. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    c1 == Underwood and c2 == Vazquez => c1_to_int == c2_to_int - 40, for all c1, c2 in capacities.

-   The facility with seating for 190 people is either the lacrosse facility or Underwood Arena:
    This is a constraint that states that the facility with a capacity of 190 people is either the lacrosse facility or Underwood Arena, but not both. So:
    Xor([Capacity190 == Lacrosse, Capacity190 == Underwood]).
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Gentry == 1, and 230 == 1, and Football == 1, then Gentry is the football facility with a capacity of 230 people.

-   The football facility holds more people than Underwood Arena:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the capacities for the football facility and Underwood Arena, such that the football facility's capacity is greater than Underwood Arena's capacity. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    c1 == Football and c2 == Underwood => c1_to_int > c2_to_int, for all c1, c2 in capacities.

-   The basketball facility holds 80 more people than Vazquez Arena:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the capacities for the basketball facility and Vazquez Arena, such that the basketball facility's capacity is 80 more than Vazquez Arena's capacity. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    c1 == Basketball and c2 == Vazquez => c1_to_int == c2_to_int + 80, for all c1, c2 in capacities.

-   Young Arena holds 230 people:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Young == Capacity230.

-   Underwood Arena holds 40 fewer people than Vazquez Arena:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the capacities for Underwood Arena and Vazquez Arena, such that Underwood Arena's capacity is 40 less than Vazquez Arena's capacity. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    c1 == Underwood and c2 == Vazquez => c1_to_int == c2_to_int - 40, for all c1, c2 in capacities.

-   The facility with seating for 190 people is either the lacrosse facility or Underwood Arena:
    This is a constraint that states that the facility with a capacity of 190 people is either the lacrosse facility or Underwood Arena, but not both. So:

Clues:
The Leden drove 25 miles farther than the automobile with a high speed of 75 MPH.
The Poltris drove 25 miles farther than the automobile with a high speed of 69 MPH.
The Awick drove somewhat less than the automobile with a high speed of 81 MPH.
The car with a high speed of 69 MPH drove somewhat farther than the automobile with a high speed of 81 MPH.

Entities:
cars: Awick, Leden, Poltris, Versem
distances: 525 miles, 550 miles, 575 miles, 600 miles
speeds: 62 MPH, 69 MPH, 75 MPH, 81 MPH
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Awick == 1, and Distance525 == 1, and Speed62 == 1, then Awick is the car that drove 525 miles at a high speed of 62 MPH.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the cars: Awick, Leden, Poltris, Versem (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Distances driven by the cars: Distance525, Distance550, Distance575, Distance600 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   High speeds of the cars: Speed62, Speed69, Speed75, Speed81 (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The Leden drove 25 miles farther than the automobile with a high speed of 75 MPH:
    For each possible assignment of distances for Leden and the automobile with a high speed of 75 MPH, Leden's distance is 25 miles greater. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    d1 == Leden and d2 == Speed75 => d1_to_int == d2_to_int + 25, for all d1, d2 in distances.

-   The Poltris drove 25 miles farther than the automobile with a high speed of 69 MPH:
    For each possible assignment of distances for Poltris and the automobile with a high speed of 69 MPH, Poltris's distance is 25 miles greater. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    d1 == Poltris and d2 == Speed69 => d1_to_int == d2_to_int + 25, for all d1, d2 in distances.

-   The Awick drove somewhat less than the automobile with a high speed of 81 MPH:
    For each possible assignment of distances for Awick and the automobile with a high speed of 81 MPH, Awick's distance is less. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    d1 == Awick and d2 == Speed81 => d1_to_int < d2_to_int, for all d1, d2 in distances.

-   The car with a high speed of 69 MPH drove somewhat farther than the automobile with a high speed of 81 MPH:
    For each possible assignment of distances for the car with a high speed of 69 MPH and the car with a high speed of 81 MPH, the distance of the car with a high speed of 69 MPH is greater. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    d1 == Speed69 and d2 == Speed81 => d1_to_int > d2_to_int, for all d1, d2 in distances.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Awick == 1, and Distance525 == 1, and Speed62 == 1, then Awick is the car that drove 525 miles at a high speed of 62 MPH.

-   High speeds of the cars: Speed62, Speed69, Speed75, Speed81 (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The Leden drove 25 miles farther than the automobile with a high speed of 75 MPH:
    For each possible assignment of distances for Leden and the automobile with a high speed of 75 MPH, Leden's distance is 25 miles greater. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    d1 == Leden and d2 == Speed75 => d1_to_int == d2_to_int + 25, for all d1, d2 in distances.

-   The Poltris drove 25 miles farther than the automobile with a high speed of 69 MPH:
    For each possible assignment of distances for Poltris and the automobile with a high speed of 69 MPH, Poltris's distance is 25 miles greater. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    d1 == Poltris and d2 == Speed69 => d1_to_int == d2_to_int + 25, for all d1, d2 in distances.

-   The Awick drove somewhat less than the automobile with a high speed of 81 MPH:
    For each possible assignment of distances for Awick and the automobile with a high speed of 81 MPH, Awick's distance is less. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    d1 == Awick and d2 == Speed81 => d1_to_int < d2_to_int, for all d1, d2 in distances.

-   The car with a high speed of 69 MPH drove somewhat farther than the automobile with a high speed of 81 MPH:
    For each possible assignment of distances for the car with a high speed of 69 MPH and the car with a high speed of 81 MPH, the distance of the car with a high speed of 69 MPH is greater. So, the constraints will be of the form:

Clues:
The report from Zearing was either the August 4 report or Edith Estes's report.
Hal Harrison's report was submitted sometime after Iva Ingram's sighting.
The August 5 sighting was from Islesboro.
The report from Tarzana was submitted 1 day before the sighting from Islesboro.
Benny Baron's report was received on August 7.

Entities:
witnesses: Benny Baron, Edith Estes, Hal Harrison, Iva Ingram
dates: August 4, August 5, August 6, August 7
towns: Islesboro, Long Barn, Tarzana, Zearing
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if BennyBaron == 1, and August7 == 1, and Islesboro == 1, then Benny Baron's report was received on August 7 from Islesboro.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the witnesses: BennyBaron, EdithEstes, HalHarrison, IvaIngram (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Dates of the reports: August4, August5, August6, August7 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Names of the towns: Islesboro, LongBarn, Tarzana, Zearing (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The report from Zearing was either the August 4 report or Edith Estes's report:
    This is a constraint that states that the report from Zearing's date is either August 4 or the date of Edith Estes's report, but not both. So:
    Xor([Zearing == August4, Zearing == EdithEstes]).

-   Hal Harrison's report was submitted sometime after Iva Ingram's sighting:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the dates for Hal Harrison and Iva Ingram, such that Hal Harrison's report date is greater than Iva Ingram's report date. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    d1 == HalHarrison and d2 == IvaIngram => d1_to_int > d2_to_int, for all d1, d2 in dates.

-   The August 5 sighting was from Islesboro:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    August5 == Islesboro.

-   The report from Tarzana was submitted 1 day before the sighting from Islesboro:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the dates for Tarzana and Islesboro, such that Tarzana's report date is 1 less than Islesboro's report date. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    d1 == Tarzana and d2 == Islesboro => d1_to_int == d2_to_int - 1, for all d1, d2 in dates.

-   Benny Baron's report was received on August 7:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    BennyBaron == August7.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if BennyBaron == 1, and August7 == 1, and Islesboro == 1, then Benny Baron's report was received on August 7 from Islesboro.

### Decision variables:

    This is a constraint that states that the report from Zearing's date is either August 4 or the date of Edith Estes's report, but not both. So:
    Xor([Zearing == August4, Zearing == EdithEstes]).

-   Hal Harrison's report was submitted sometime after Iva Ingram's sighting:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the dates for Hal Harrison and Iva Ingram, such that Hal Harrison's report date is greater than Iva Ingram's report date. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    d1 == HalHarrison and d2 == IvaIngram => d1_to_int > d2_to_int, for all d1, d2 in dates.

-   The August 5 sighting was from Islesboro:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    August5 == Islesboro.

-   The report from Tarzana was submitted 1 day before the sighting from Islesboro:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the dates for Tarzana and Islesboro, such that Tarzana's report date is 1 less than Islesboro's report date. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    d1 == Tarzana and d2 == Islesboro => d1_to_int == d2_to_int - 1, for all d1, d2 in dates.

-   Benny Baron's report was received on August 7:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    BennyBaron == August7.

Entities:

ages: 4, 5, 8, 9
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Merlin == 1, and 102inches == 1, and Age4 == 1, then Merlin is the condor with a wingspan of 102 inches and is 4 years old.

Clues:
The puzzle with the autumn leaves theme has somewhat more than the jigsaw puzzle with the rustic village theme.
The four puzzles are the puzzle made by Buralde, the jigsaw puzzle with the rustic village theme, the puzzle with the autumn leaves theme and the puzzle with 1000 pieces.
The jigsaw puzzle made by Buralde has the outer space theme.
The jigsaw puzzle made by Denlend has somewhat fewer than the jigsaw puzzle with the outer space theme.
The jigsaw puzzle made by Kimsight has 250 more pieces than the puzzle made by Denlend.

Entities:
companies: Buralde, Denlend, Irycia, Kimsight
pieces: 250, 500, 750, 1000
themes: autumn leaves, coral reef, outer space, rustic village
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same quartet. For example, if Buralde == 1, and 1000 == 1, and OuterSpace == 1, then the puzzle made by Buralde has 1000 pieces and the outer space theme.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the companies: Buralde, Denlend, Irycia, Kimsight (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Number of pieces in the puzzles: Pieces250, Pieces500, Pieces750, Pieces1000 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Themes of the puzzles: AutumnLeaves, CoralReef, OuterSpace, RusticVillage (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The puzzle with the autumn leaves theme has somewhat more pieces than the jigsaw puzzle with the rustic village theme:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the number of pieces for the autumn leaves theme and the rustic village theme, such that the autumn leaves theme's puzzle has more pieces than the rustic village theme's puzzle. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == AutumnLeaves and p2 == RusticVillage => p1_to_int > p2_to_int, for all p1, p2 in pieces.

-   The four puzzles are the puzzle made by Buralde, the jigsaw puzzle with the rustic village theme, the puzzle with the autumn leaves theme, and the puzzle with 1000 pieces:
    This is a constraint that states that all these entities are different, thus:
    AllDifferent([Buralde, RusticVillage, AutumnLeaves, Pieces1000]).

-   The jigsaw puzzle made by Buralde has the outer space theme:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Buralde == OuterSpace.

-   The jigsaw puzzle made by Denlend has somewhat fewer pieces than the jigsaw puzzle with the outer space theme:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the number of pieces for Denlend and the outer space theme, such that Denlend's puzzle has fewer pieces than the outer space theme's puzzle. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Denlend and p2 == OuterSpace => p1_to_int < p2_to_int, for all p1, p2 in pieces.

-   The jigsaw puzzle made by Kimsight has 250 more pieces than the puzzle made by Denlend:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the number of pieces for Kimsight and Denlend, such that Kimsight's puzzle has 250 more pieces than Denlend's puzzle. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Kimsight and p2 == Denlend => p1_to_int == p2_to_int + 250, for all p1, p2 in pieces.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same quartet. For example, if Buralde == 1, and 1000 == 1, and OuterSpace == 1, then the puzzle made by Buralde has 1000 pieces and the outer space theme.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the companies: Buralde, Denlend, Irycia, Kimsight (all different, 1 to 4)

    This is a constraint that states that all these entities are different, thus:
    AllDifferent([Buralde, RusticVillage, AutumnLeaves, Pieces1000]).

-   The jigsaw puzzle made by Buralde has the outer space theme:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Buralde == OuterSpace.

-   The jigsaw puzzle made by Denlend has somewhat fewer pieces than the jigsaw puzzle with the outer space theme:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the number of pieces for Denlend and the outer space theme, such that Denlend's puzzle has fewer pieces than the outer space theme's puzzle. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Denlend and p2 == OuterSpace => p1_to_int < p2_to_int, for all p1, p2 in pieces.

-   The jigsaw puzzle made by Kimsight has 250 more pieces than the puzzle made by Denlend:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the number of pieces for Kimsight and Denlend, such that Kimsight's puzzle has 250 more pieces than Denlend's puzzle. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Kimsight and p2 == Denlend => p1_to_int == p2_to_int + 250, for all p1, p2 in pieces.

Clues:
The worker who works in the green section served more riders than Brett.
Peter served 25 fewer riders than Willis.
Brett served more riders than Peter.
The person who works in the yellow section served 25 more riders than the worker who works in the orange section.
Peter is either the person who served 125 riders or the person who works in the blue section.

Entities:
employees: Brett, Peter, Victor, Willis
rides: 50 riders, 75 riders, 100 riders, 125 riders
section: blue, green, orange, yellow
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Brett == 1, and Riders50 == 1, and Green == 1, then Brett is the worker who served 50 riders and works in the green section.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the employees: Brett, Peter, Victor, Willis (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Number of riders served: Riders50, Riders75, Riders100, Riders125 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Colors of the sections: Blue, Green, Orange, Yellow (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The worker who works in the green section served more riders than Brett:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the number of riders served by the worker in the green section and Brett, such that the green section's worker served more riders than Brett. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    r1 == Green and r2 == Brett => r1_to_int > r2_to_int, for all r1, r2 in rides.

-   Peter served 25 fewer riders than Willis:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the number of riders served by Peter and Willis, such that Peter served 25 fewer riders than Willis. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    r1 == Peter and r2 == Willis => r1_to_int == r2_to_int - 25, for all r1, r2 in rides.

-   Brett served more riders than Peter:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the number of riders served by Brett and Peter, such that Brett served more riders than Peter. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    r1 == Brett and r2 == Peter => r1_to_int > r2_to_int, for all r1, r2 in rides.

-   The person who works in the yellow section served 25 more riders than the worker who works in the orange section:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the number of riders served by the worker in the yellow section and the worker in the orange section, such that the yellow section's worker served 25 more riders than the orange section's worker. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    r1 == Yellow and r2 == Orange => r1_to_int == r2_to_int + 25, for all r1, r2 in rides.

-   Peter is either the person who served 125 riders or the person who works in the blue section:
    This is a constraint that states that Peter's number of riders served is either 125 or Peter works in the blue section, but not both. So:
    Xor([Peter == Riders125, Peter == Blue]).
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Brett == 1, and Riders50 == 1, and Green == 1, then Brett is the worker who served 50 riders and works in the green section.

-   Brett served more riders than Peter:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the number of riders served by Brett and Peter, such that Brett served more riders than Peter. So, the constraints will be of the form:

-   The person who works in the yellow section served 25 more riders than the worker who works in the orange section:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the number of riders served by the worker in the yellow section and the worker in the orange section, such that the yellow section's worker served 25 more riders than the orange section's worker. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    r1 == Yellow and r2 == Orange => r1_to_int == r2_to_int + 25, for all r1, r2 in rides.

-   Peter is either the person who served 125 riders or the person who works in the blue section:
    This is a constraint that states that Peter's number of riders served is either 125 or Peter works in the blue section, but not both. So:

Clues:
The team from Venezuela finished with 4 gold medals.
The squad that won 2 gold medals ended with 6 silver medals.
The four teams were the squad from Zimbabwe, the team that won 3 gold medals, the squad that won 6 silver medals and the squad that won 8 silver medals.
The team from Dominica ended the games with 1 fewer gold medal than the squad that won 5 silver medals.

Entities:
countries: Dominica, Jordan, Venezuela, Zimbabwe
gold medals: 1, 2, 3, 4
silver medals: 2, 5, 6, 8
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Dominica == 1, and Gold1 == 1, and Silver2 == 1, then Dominica won 1 gold medal and 2 silver medals.

### Constraints:
-   The team from Venezuela finished with 4 gold medals:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Venezuela == Gold4.

-   The squad that won 2 gold medals ended with 6 silver medals:
    This is a direct assignment constraint linking gold medals to silver medals:
    Gold2 == Silver6.

-   The four teams were the squad from Zimbabwe, the team that won 3 gold medals, the squad that won 6 silver medals, and the squad that won 8 silver medals:
    This is a constraint that states that all these entities are different, thus:
    AllDifferent([Zimbabwe, Gold3, Silver6, Silver8]).

-   The team from Dominica ended the games with 1 fewer gold medal than the squad that won 5 silver medals:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the number of gold medals for Dominica and the squad that won 5 silver medals, such that Dominica's gold medals are 1 less than the squad's gold medals that won 5 silver medals. So, the constraints will be of the form:

Clues:
The Vorckin impact crater is 125 meters wide.
The 150 meters wide one is either the Ordovician impact crater or the Permian impact crater.
The Ordovician impact crater is 25 meters wider than the Jurassic impact crater.
The Triassic impact crater is either the Ormagh impact crater or the 150 meters wide one.
The Cersay impact crater was formed during the Jurassic period.

Entities:
craters: Cersay, Moriwa, Ormagh, Vorckin
diameters: 100 meters, 125 meters, 150 meters, 175 meters
periods: Jurassic, Ordovician, Permian, Triassic
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Cersay == 1, and 100meters == 1, and Jurassic == 1, then Cersay is the crater with a diameter of 100 meters and was formed during the Jurassic period.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the craters: Cersay, Moriwa, Ormagh, Vorckin (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Diameters of the craters: Diameter100, Diameter125, Diameter150, Diameter175 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Geological periods of the craters: Jurassic, Ordovician, Permian, Triassic (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The Vorckin impact crater is 125 meters wide:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Vorckin == Diameter125.

-   The 150 meters wide one is either the Ordovician impact crater or the Permian impact crater:
    This is a constraint that states that the crater with a diameter of 150 meters is either associated with the Ordovician period or the Permian period, but not both. So:
    Xor([Diameter150 == Ordovician, Diameter150 == Permian]).

-   The Ordovician impact crater is 25 meters wider than the Jurassic impact crater:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the diameters for the Ordovician and Jurassic craters, such that the Ordovician crater's diameter is 25 meters wider than the Jurassic crater's diameter. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    d1 == Ordovician and d2 == Jurassic => d1_to_int == d2_to_int + 25, for all d1, d2 in diameters.

-   The Triassic impact crater is either the Ormagh impact crater or the 150 meters wide one:
    This is a constraint that states that the Triassic crater is either Ormagh or has a diameter of 150 meters, but not both. So:
    Xor([Triassic == Ormagh, Triassic == Diameter150]).

-   The Cersay impact crater was formed during the Jurassic period:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Cersay == Jurassic.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Cersay == 1, and 100meters == 1, and Jurassic == 1, then Cersay is the crater with a diameter of 100 meters and was formed during the Jurassic period.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the craters: Cersay, Moriwa, Ormagh, Vorckin (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Diameters of the craters: Diameter100, Diameter125, Diameter150, Diameter175 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Geological periods of the craters: Jurassic, Ordovician, Permian, Triassic (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The Vorckin impact crater is 125 meters wide:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Vorckin == Diameter125.

-   The 150 meters wide one is either the Ordovician impact crater or the Permian impact crater:
    This is a constraint that states that the crater with a diameter of 150 meters is either associated with the Ordovician period or the Permian period, but not both. So:
    Xor([Diameter150 == Ordovician, Diameter150 == Permian]).

-   The Ordovician impact crater is 25 meters wider than the Jurassic impact crater:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the diameters for the Ordovician and Jurassic craters, such that the Ordovician crater's diameter is 25 meters wider than the Jurassic crater's diameter. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    d1 == Ordovician and d2 == Jurassic => d1_to_int == d2_to_int + 25, for all d1, d2 in diameters.

-   The Triassic impact crater is either the Ormagh impact crater or the 150 meters wide one:
    This is a constraint that states that the Triassic crater is either Ormagh or has a diameter of 150 meters, but not both. So:

Clues:
The butterfly that was auctioned 7th sold for 20 dollars less than the insect won by Daniel.
The four butterflies were the insect that sold for $260, the butterfly that was auctioned 4th, the butterfly that was auctioned 7th and the butterfly won by Roland.
The butterfly won by Gabriel was the 8th lot.

Entities:
winners: Daniel, Gabriel, Roland, Vincent
prices: $250, $260, $270, $280
orders: 3rd, 4th, 7th, 8th
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Daniel == 1, and $260 == 1, and 3rd == 1, then Daniel won the butterfly that was auctioned 3rd and sold for $260.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the winners: Daniel, Gabriel, Roland, Vincent (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Prices of the butterflies: Price250, Price260, Price270, Price280 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Orders of the auction: Order3rd, Order4th, Order7th, Order8th (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The butterfly that was auctioned 7th sold for 20 dollars less than the insect won by Daniel:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the prices for the butterfly auctioned 7th and the butterfly won by Daniel, such that the butterfly auctioned 7th's price is 20 dollars less than Daniel's butterfly's price. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Order7th and p2 == Daniel => p1_to_int == p2_to_int - 20, for all p1, p2 in prices.

-   The four butterflies were the insect that sold for $260, the butterfly that was auctioned 4th, the butterfly that was auctioned 7th, and the butterfly won by Roland:
    This is a constraint that states that all these entities are different, thus:
    AllDifferent([Price260, Order4th, Order7th, Roland]).

-   The butterfly won by Gabriel was the 8th lot:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Gabriel == Order8th.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet.

Clues:
Vasquez will leave sometime after Macdonald.
Vasquez will leave 1 month before the ambassador with the 5 day visit.
Gilbert is either the person leaving in January or the ambassador with the 4 day visit.
Macdonald will leave 1 month before the ambassador with the 4 day visit.
The ambassador with the 4 day visit will leave sometime before the ambassador with the 9 day visit.

Entities:
diplomats: Gilbert, Macdonald, Pickett, Vasquez
months: January, February, March, April
durations: 4 day, 5 day, 9 day, 10 day
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Gilbert == 1, and January == 1, and Day4 == 1, then Gilbert is the ambassador leaving in January with a 4-day visit.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the diplomats: Gilbert, Macdonald, Pickett, Vasquez (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Months of departure: January, February, March, April (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Visit durations: Day4, Day5, Day9, Day10 (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   Vasquez will leave sometime after Macdonald:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months of departure for Vasquez and Macdonald, such that Vasquez's month of departure is greater than Macdonald's month of departure. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == Vasquez and m2 == Macdonald => m1_to_int > m2_to_int, for all m1, m2 in months of departure.

-   Vasquez will leave 1 month before the ambassador with the 5-day visit:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months of departure for Vasquez and the ambassador with the 5-day visit, such that Vasquez's month of departure is 1 less than the ambassador's month of departure. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == Vasquez and m2 == Day5 => m1_to_int == m2_to_int - 1, for all m1, m2 in months of departure.

-   Gilbert is either the person leaving in January or the ambassador with the 4-day visit:
    This is a constraint that states that Gilbert's month of departure is either January or the month of departure of the ambassador with the 4-day visit, but not both. So:

    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months of departure for Macdonald and the ambassador with the 4-day visit, such that Macdonald's month of departure is 1 less than the 4-day month of departure. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == Macdonald and m2 == Day4 => m1_to_int == m2_to_int - 1, for all m1, m2 in months of departure.

-   The ambassador with the 4-day visit will leave sometime before the ambassador with the 9-day visit:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months of departure for the ambassador with the 4-day visit and the ambassador with the 9-day visit, such that the 4-day month of departure is less than the 9-day month of departure. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == Day4 and m2 == Day9 => m1_to_int < m2_to_int, for all m1, m2 in months of departure.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet.

    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of scholarships for Hattie and the student majoring in Physics, such that Hattie's scholarship amount is $10,000 more than the student majoring in Physics. So, the constraints will be of the form:

Clues:
Hatcha started 6 years after the wing back.
Kawa began playing in 1982.
Banben was the center back.
The person who started in 1985 was either Kawa or the center forward.

Entities:
players: Banben, Hatcha, Kawa, Rothvum
years: 1976, 1979, 1982, 1985
positions: center back, center forward, goalie, wing back
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Banben == 1, and 1976 == 1, and CenterBack == 1, then Banben began playing in 1976 as a center back.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the players: Banben, Hatcha, Kawa, Rothvum (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Start years of the players: Year1976, Year1979, Year1982, Year1985 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Positions of the players: CenterBack, CenterForward, Goalie, WingBack (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   Hatcha started 6 years after the wing back:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the start years for Hatcha and the wing back, such that Hatcha's start year is 6 years after the wing back's start year. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    y1 == Hatcha and y2 == WingBack => y1_to_int == y2_to_int + 6, for all y1, y2 in years.

-   Kawa began playing in 1982:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Kawa == Year1982.

-   Banben was the center back:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Banben == CenterBack.

-   The person who started in 1985 was either Kawa or the center forward:
    This is a constraint that states that the player who started in 1985 is either Kawa or the center forward, but not both. So:
    Xor([Year1985 == Kawa, Year1985 == CenterForward]).
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Banben == 1, and 1976 == 1, and CenterBack == 1, then Banben began playing in 1976 as a center back.

    y1 == Hatcha and y2 == WingBack => y1_to_int == y2_to_int + 6, for all y1, y2 in years.

-   Kawa began playing in 1982:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Kawa == Year1982.

-   Banben was the center back:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Banben == CenterBack.

-   The person who started in 1985 was either Kawa or the center forward:
    This is a constraint that states that the player who started in 1985 is either Kawa or the center forward, but not both. So:

Clues:
The puzzle with the postage stamp theme has somewhat fewer than the puzzle made by Astury.
The jigsaw puzzle with the outer space theme has 250 more pieces than the puzzle made by Garroda.
The jigsaw puzzle made by Garroda has somewhat fewer than the puzzle made by Vesem.
The jigsaw puzzle with the postage stamp theme has somewhat more than the puzzle with the city skyline theme.
The jigsaw puzzle made by Vesem has 500 pieces.

Entities:
companies: Astury, Denlend, Garroda, Vesem
pieces: 250, 500, 750, 1000
themes: autumn leaves, city skyline, outer space, postage stamp
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same quartet. For example, if Astury == 1, and 250 == 1, and PostageStamp == 1, then the puzzle made by Astury has 250 pieces and the postage stamp theme.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the companies: Astury, Denlend, Garroda, Vesem (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Number of pieces in the puzzles: Pieces250, Pieces500, Pieces750, Pieces1000 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Themes of the puzzles: AutumnLeaves, CitySkyline, OuterSpace, PostageStamp (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The puzzle with the postage stamp theme has somewhat fewer pieces than the puzzle made by Astury:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the number of pieces for the postage stamp theme and Astury, such that the postage stamp theme's puzzle has fewer pieces than Astury's puzzle. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == PostageStamp and p2 == Astury => p1_to_int < p2_to_int, for all p1, p2 in pieces.

-   The jigsaw puzzle with the outer space theme has 250 more pieces than the puzzle made by Garroda:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the number of pieces for the outer space theme and Garroda, such that the outer space theme's puzzle has 250 more pieces than Garroda's puzzle. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == OuterSpace and p2 == Garroda => p1_to_int == p2_to_int + 250, for all p1, p2 in pieces.

-   The jigsaw puzzle made by Garroda has somewhat fewer pieces than the puzzle made by Vesem:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the number of pieces for Garroda and Vesem, such that Garroda's puzzle has fewer pieces than Vesem's puzzle. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Garroda and p2 == Vesem => p1_to_int < p2_to_int, for all p1, p2 in pieces.

-   The jigsaw puzzle with the postage stamp theme has somewhat more pieces than the puzzle with the city skyline theme:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the number of pieces for the postage stamp theme and the city skyline theme, such that the postage stamp theme's puzzle has more pieces than the city skyline theme's puzzle. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == PostageStamp and p2 == CitySkyline => p1_to_int > p2_to_int, for all p1, p2 in pieces.

-   The jigsaw puzzle made by Vesem has 500 pieces:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Vesem == Pieces500.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same quartet. For example, if Astury == 1, and 250 == 1, and PostageStamp == 1, then the puzzle made by Astury has 250 pieces and the postage stamp theme.

### Decision variables:

    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the number of pieces for the postage stamp theme and Astury, such that the postage stamp theme's puzzle has fewer pieces than Astury's puzzle. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == PostageStamp and p2 == Astury => p1_to_int < p2_to_int, for all p1, p2 in pieces.

-   The jigsaw puzzle with the outer space theme has 250 more pieces than the puzzle made by Garroda:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the number of pieces for the outer space theme and Garroda, such that the outer space theme's puzzle has 250 more pieces than Garroda's puzzle. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == OuterSpace and p2 == Garroda => p1_to_int == p2_to_int + 250, for all p1, p2 in pieces.

-   The jigsaw puzzle made by Garroda has somewhat fewer pieces than the puzzle made by Vesem:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the number of pieces for Garroda and Vesem, such that Garroda's puzzle has fewer pieces than Vesem's puzzle. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Garroda and p2 == Vesem => p1_to_int < p2_to_int, for all p1, p2 in pieces.

-   The jigsaw puzzle with the postage stamp theme has somewhat more pieces than the puzzle with the city skyline theme:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the number of pieces for the postage stamp theme and the city skyline theme, such that the postage stamp theme's puzzle has more pieces than the city skyline theme's puzzle. So, the constraints will be of the form:

Clues:
The photo published by Nature Monthly was taken 2 months after the photo published by Earth Aware.
The shot of the white rhino was either the photo published by Earth Aware or the photo published by Animal Science.
The photo of the polar bear was taken sometime before the shot of the white rhino.
The photo taken in April was published by Animal Science.
The photo of the giant tortoise was taken in June.

Entities:
animals: giant tortoise, orangutan, polar bear, white rhino
months: March, April, May, June
magazines: Animal Science, Earth Aware, Nature Monthly, Wildzone
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if GiantTortoise == 1, and June == 1, and AnimalScience == 1, then the photo of the giant tortoise was taken in June and published by Animal Science.

### Decision variables:

-   Magazines that published the photos: AnimalScience, EarthAware, NatureMonthly, Wildzone (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The photo published by Nature Monthly was taken 2 months after the photo published by Earth Aware:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months when the photos were taken for Nature Monthly and Earth Aware, such that the photo published by Nature Monthly was taken 2 months after the photo published by Earth Aware. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == NatureMonthly and m2 == EarthAware => m1_to_int == m2_to_int + 2, for all m1, m2 in months.

-   The shot of the white rhino was either the photo published by Earth Aware or the photo published by Animal Science:
    This is a constraint that states that the shot of the white rhino is associated with either Earth Aware or Animal Science, but not both. So:
    Xor([WhiteRhino == EarthAware, WhiteRhino == AnimalScience]).

-   The photo of the polar bear was taken sometime before the shot of the white rhino:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months when the photos were taken for the polar bear and the white rhino, such that the photo of the polar bear was taken sometime before the shot of the white rhino. So, the constraints will be of the form:

Entities:

heights: 100 ft, 105 ft, 110 ft, 115 ft
countries: Canada, Brazil, New Zealand, Switzerland
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Cerbel == 1, and 100ft == 1, and Canada == 1, then Cerbel is the 100 ft tall waterfall located in Canada.

### Constraints:
-   Oginao is either the 105 ft tall fall or the 115 ft tall waterfall:
    This is a constraint that states that Oginao's height is either 105 ft or 115 ft, but not both. So:

-   Oginao is 5 ft shorter than Irskela:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the heights for Oginao and Irskela, such that Oginao's height is 5 ft shorter than Irskela's height. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    h1 == Oginao and h2 == Irskela => h1_to_int == h2_to_int - 5, for all h1, h2 in heights.

-   The fall in Brazil is either Cerbel or Inawatai:
    This is a constraint that states that the waterfall in Brazil is either Cerbel or Inawatai, but not both. So:

-   Inawatai is in New Zealand:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:

    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the heights for Cerbel and the waterfall in Canada, such that Cerbel's height is 10 ft shorter than the waterfall in Canada's height. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    h1 == Cerbel and h2 == Canada => h1_to_int == h2_to_int - 10, for all h1, h2 in heights.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Cerbel == 1, and 100ft == 1, and Canada == 1, then Cerbel is the 100 ft tall waterfall located in Canada.

-   The fall in Brazil is either Cerbel or Inawatai:
    This is a constraint that states that the waterfall in Brazil is either Cerbel or Inawatai, but not both. So:
    Xor([Brazil == Cerbel, Brazil == Inawatai]).

-   Inawatai is in New Zealand:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Inawatai == New Zealand.

-   Cerbel is 10 ft shorter than the fall in Canada:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the heights for Cerbel and the waterfall in Canada, such that Cerbel's height is 10 ft shorter than the waterfall in Canada's height. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    h1 == Cerbel and h2 == Canada => h1_to_int == h2_to_int - 10, for all h1, h2 in heights.

Clues:
The 90 million year old fossil costs 250 dollars more than the pilodontus.
The gigasaurus costs 500 dollars more than the 78 million year old fossil.
The gigasaurus costs 250 dollars less than the 75 million year old fossil.
The mirasaurus is 90 million years old.

Entities:
dinosaurs: gigasaurus, mirasaurus, pilodontus, rotosaurus
prices: $500, $750, $1000, $1250
ages: 72 million, 75 million, 78 million, 90 million
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if gigasaurus == 1, and Price500 == 1, and Age72 == 1, then gigasaurus costs $500 and is 72 million years old.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the dinosaurs: gigasaurus, mirasaurus, pilodontus, rotosaurus (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Prices of the dinosaurs: Price500, Price750, Price1000, Price1250 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Ages of the dinosaurs: Age72, Age75, Age78, Age90 (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The 90 million year old fossil costs 250 dollars more than the pilodontus:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of prices to the 90 million year old fossil and the pilodontus, such that the 90 million year old fossil's price is 250 dollars more than the pilodontus's price. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == 90 million year old fossil and p2 == pilodontus => p1_to_int == p2_to_int + 250, for all p1, p2 in prices.

-   The gigasaurus costs 500 dollars more than the 78 million year old fossil:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of prices to the gigasaurus and the 78 million year old fossil, such that the gigasaurus's price is 500 dollars more than the 78 million year old fossil's price. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == gigasaurus and p2 == 78 million year old fossil => p1_to_int == p2_to_int + 500, for all p1, p2 in prices.

-   The gigasaurus costs 250 dollars less than the 75 million year old fossil:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of prices to the gigasaurus and the 75 million year old fossil, such that the gigasaurus's price is 250 dollars less than the 75 million year old fossil's price. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == gigasaurus and p2 == 75 million year old fossil => p1_to_int == p2_to_int - 250, for all p1, p2 in prices.

-   The mirasaurus is 90 million years old:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    mirasaurus == Age90.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if gigasaurus == 1, and Price500 == 1, and Age72 == 1, then gigasaurus costs $500 and is 72 million years old.

### Constraints:

    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of prices to the gigasaurus and the 78 million year old fossil, such that the gigasaurus's price is 500 dollars more than the 78 million year old fossil's price. So, the constraints will be of the form:

The four conductors are Roderick, the conductor working on June 10, the person departing from Leland and the person departing from Indio.
The person working on June 13 will depart from Hardwick.
The conductor working on June 12 is either the conductor departing from Indio or Roderick.
Vernon is either the person working on June 11 or the conductor working on June 13.
Francis will leave sometime before the conductor departing from Leland.

Entities:
names: Francis, Luke, Roderick, Vernon
days: June 10, June 11, June 12, June 13
departures: Hardwick, Indio, Kent, Leland
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Francis == 1, and June10 == 1, and Hardwick == 1, then Francis works on June 10 and departs from Hardwick.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the conductors: Francis, Luke, Roderick, Vernon (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Days of work: June10, June11, June12, June13 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Departure locations: Hardwick, Indio, Kent, Leland (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The four conductors are Roderick, the conductor working on June 10, the person departing from Leland, and the person departing from Indio:
    This is a constraint that states that all these entities are different, thus:
    AllDifferent([Roderick, June10, Leland, Indio]).

-   The person working on June 13 will depart from Hardwick:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    June13 == Hardwick.

-   The conductor working on June 12 is either the conductor departing from Indio or Roderick:
    This is a constraint that states that the conductor working on June 12 is either from Indio or is Roderick, but not both. So:
    Xor([June12 == Indio, June12 == Roderick]).

-   Vernon is either the person working on June 11 or the conductor working on June 13:
    This is a constraint that states that Vernon is either working on June 11 or working on June 13, but not both. So:
    Xor([Vernon == June11, Vernon == June13]).

-   Francis will leave sometime before the conductor departing from Leland:
    This is a constraint that states that Francis will leave before the conductor departing from Leland. So:
    Francis < Leland.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Francis == 1, and June10 == 1, and Hardwick == 1, then Francis works on June 10 and departs from Hardwick.

    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    June13 == Hardwick.

-   The conductor working on June 12 is either the conductor departing from Indio or Roderick:
    This is a constraint that states that the conductor working on June 12 is either from Indio or is Roderick, but not both. So:
    Xor([June12 == Indio, June12 == Roderick]).

-   Vernon is either the person working on June 11 or the conductor working on June 13:
    This is a constraint that states that Vernon is either working on June 11 or working on June 13, but not both. So:
    Xor([Vernon == June11, Vernon == June13]).

### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if AnnAlexander == 1, and Contract4 == 1, and Fiat == 1, then Ann Alexander's reservation is for a 4-day rental of a Fiat.

-   Car rentals: Fiat, Kia, Nissan, Toyota (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The Kia rental is for a period 1 day shorter than the Toyota rental:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the contract lengths for the Kia and Toyota rentals, such that the Kia rental is 1 day shorter than the Toyota rental. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    c1 == Kia and c2 == Toyota => c1_to_int == c2_to_int - 1, for all c1, c2 in contracts.

-   The 4 day rental is for the Fiat:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Contract4 == Fiat.

-   Kathy Koch's reservation is either the 5 day reservation or the Fiat rental:
    This is a constraint that states that Kathy Koch's reservation is either for 5 days or for the Fiat rental, but not both. So:
    Xor([KathyKoch == Contract5, KathyKoch == Fiat]).

-   The 3 day rental, Irene Ingram's reservation, and Kathy Koch's reservation are all different rentals:
    This is a constraint that states that all these entities are different, thus:

-   Ann Alexander's rental is for 4 days:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    AnnAlexander == Contract4.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if AnnAlexander == 1, and Contract4 == 1, and Fiat == 1, then Ann Alexander's reservation is for a 4-day rental of a Fiat.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the customers: AnnAlexander, EdnaErickson, IreneIngram, KathyKoch (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Length of the rental contracts: Contract2, Contract3, Contract4, Contract5 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Car rentals: Fiat, Kia, Nissan, Toyota (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The Kia rental is for a period 1 day shorter than the Toyota rental:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the contract lengths for the Kia and Toyota rentals, such that the Kia rental is 1 day shorter than the Toyota rental. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    c1 == Kia and c2 == Toyota => c1_to_int == c2_to_int - 1, for all c1, c2 in contracts.

-   The 4 day rental is for the Fiat:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Contract4 == Fiat.

-   Kathy Koch's reservation is either the 5 day reservation or the Fiat rental:
    This is a constraint that states that Kathy Koch's reservation is either for 5 days or for the Fiat rental, but not both. So:

### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Facebook120 == 1, and LinkedIn57 == 1, and Jonathan == 1, then the person with 120 Facebook friends has 57 LinkedIn connections and is named Jonathan.

So, the constraints will be of the form:
    l1 == LinkedIn72 and l2 == LinkedIn84 => f1_to_int == f2_to_int - 10, for all l1, l2 in LinkedIn.

-   Yvonne has 20 fewer Facebook friends than Margie:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of Facebook friends for Yvonne and Margie, such that Yvonne has 20 fewer Facebook friends than Margie. So, the constraints will be of the form:

    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of LinkedIn connections for the person with 72 connections and the person with 84 connections, such that the person with 72 connections has 10 fewer Facebook friends than the person with 84 connections. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    l1 == LinkedIn72 and l2 == LinkedIn84 => f1_to_int == f2_to_int - 10, for all l1, l2 in LinkedIn.

-   Yvonne has 20 fewer Facebook friends than Margie:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of Facebook friends for Yvonne and Margie, such that Yvonne has 20 fewer Facebook friends than Margie. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    f1 == Yvonne and f2 == Margie => f1_to_int == f2_to_int - 20, for all f1, f2 in Facebook.

-   The four people are the one with 68 LinkedIn connections, Jonathan, Rosie, and the person with 120 Facebook friends:
    This is a constraint that states the four people are the one with 68 LinkedIn connections, Jonathan, Rosie, and the person with 120 Facebook friends. So, the constraints will be:
    AllDifferent([LinkedIn68, Jonathan, Rosie, Facebook120]).

-   Rosie has 150 Facebook friends:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Facebook150 == Rosie.

Clues:
The photo taken in April was published by Wildzone.
The shot of the giant tortoise was taken 1 month before the photo published by Science World.
The photo of the orangutan was published by The Geographer.
The photo of the snow leopard was taken 2 months after the photo published by The Geographer.

Entities:
animals: giant tortoise, orangutan, snow leopard, tree kangaroo
months: March, April, May, June
magazines: Earth Aware, Science World, The Geographer, Wildzone
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if GiantTortoise == 1, and March == 1, and EarthAware == 1, then the photo of the giant tortoise was taken in March and published by Earth Aware.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the animals: GiantTortoise, Orangutan, SnowLeopard, TreeKangaroo (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Months of the photos: March, April, May, June (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Names of the magazines: EarthAware, ScienceWorld, TheGeographer, Wildzone (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The photo taken in April was published by Wildzone:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    April == Wildzone.

-   The shot of the giant tortoise was taken 1 month before the photo published by Science World:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months for the giant tortoise and Science World photos, such that the giant tortoise's photo month is 1 month before Science World's photo month. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == GiantTortoise and m2 == ScienceWorld => m1_to_int == m2_to_int - 1, for all m1, m2 in months.

-   The photo of the orangutan was published by The Geographer:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Orangutan == TheGeographer.

-   The photo of the snow leopard was taken 2 months after the photo published by The Geographer:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months for the snow leopard and The Geographer photos, such that the snow leopard's photo month is 2 months after The Geographer's photo month. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == SnowLeopard and m2 == TheGeographer => m1_to_int == m2_to_int + 2, for all m1, m2 in months.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if GiantTortoise == 1, and March == 1, and EarthAware == 1, then the photo of the giant tortoise was taken in March and published by Earth Aware.

    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months for the snow leopard and The Geographer photos, such that the snow leopard's photo month is 2 months after The Geographer's photo month. So, the constraints will be of the form:

Clues:
Henrietta's job is either the chore that starts at 9:00am or the chore that starts at 8:00am.
Jack's task is either the job that starts at 8:00am or the living room assignment.
Jack's job starts at 10:00am.
Kay's chore starts at 8:00am.
Jack's assignment starts 2 hours after the mud room assignment.
The laundry room assignment, the chore that starts at 8:00am and the chore that starts at 11:00am are all different jobs.

Entities:
children: Henrietta, Jack, Kay, Zachary
times: 8:00am, 9:00am, 10:00am, 11:00am
rooms: dining room, laundry room, living room, mud room
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Henrietta == 1, and Time9am == 1, and DiningRoom == 1, then Henrietta's chore starts at 9:00am in the dining room.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the children: Henrietta, Jack, Kay, Zachary (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Start times of the chores: Time8am, Time9am, Time10am, Time11am (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Rooms for the chores: DiningRoom, LaundryRoom, LivingRoom, MudRoom (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   Henrietta's job is either the chore that starts at 9:00am or the chore that starts at 8:00am:
    This is a constraint that states that Henrietta's chore starts either at 9:00am or 8:00am, but not both. So:
    Xor([Henrietta == Time9am, Henrietta == Time8am]).

-   Jack's task is either the job that starts at 8:00am or the living room assignment:
    This is a constraint that states that Jack's chore starts either at 8:00am or in the living room, but not both. So:

-   Jack's job starts at 10:00am:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Jack == Time10am.

-   Kay's chore starts at 8:00am:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Kay == Time8am.

-   Jack's assignment starts 2 hours after the mud room assignment:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of times for Jack's assignment and the mud room assignment, such that Jack's assignment starts 2 hours after the mud room assignment. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    t1 == Jack and t2 == MudRoom => t1_to_int == t2_to_int + 2, for all t1, t2 in times.

-   The laundry room assignment, the chore that starts at 8:00am, and the chore that starts at 11:00am are all different jobs:
    This is a constraint that states that all these entities are different, thus:
    AllDifferent([LaundryRoom, Time8am, Time11am]).
### Plan:

-   Jack's task is either the job that starts at 8:00am or the living room assignment:
    This is a constraint that states that Jack's chore starts either at 8:00am or in the living room, but not both. So:

-   Jack's job starts at 10:00am:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Jack == Time10am.

-   Kay's chore starts at 8:00am:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Kay == Time8am.

-   Jack's assignment starts 2 hours after the mud room assignment:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of times for Jack's assignment and the mud room assignment, such that Jack's assignment starts 2 hours after the mud room assignment. So, the constraints will be of the form:

-   The 11-year-old bird has a wingspan 8 inches shorter than Charlie:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of ages for the 11-year-old bird and Charlie, such that the 11-year-old bird's wingspan is 8 inches shorter than Charlie's wingspan. So, the constraints will be of the form:

-   Angel is either the 8-year-old bird or the bird with a wingspan of 114 inches:

Clues:
The TrustCo card has an APR of 11%.
The Southwest Inc card has a limit of $2,000.
The card with an APR of 11% is either the card with the $4,000 credit limit or the one with the $20,000 credit limit.
The card with an APR of 10% is either the card with the $4,000 credit limit or the TrustCo card.
The Credit Korp card has an APR 1 percent lower than the one with the $2,000 credit limit.

Entities:

APR: 8%, 9%, 10%, 11%
credit limits: $2,000, $4,000, $5,000, $20,000
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if CreditKorp == 1, and APR8 == 1, and Limit2000 == 1, then CreditKorp has an APR of 8% and a credit limit of $2,000.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the credit cards: CreditKorp, MidAtlantic, SouthwestInc, TrustCo (all different, 1 to 4)
-   APRs of the credit cards: APR8, APR9, APR10, APR11 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Credit limits of the credit cards: Limit2000, Limit4000, Limit5000, Limit20000 (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The TrustCo card has an APR of 11%:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    TrustCo == APR11.

-   The Southwest Inc card has a limit of $2,000:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    SouthwestInc == Limit2000.

-   The card with an APR of 11% is either the card with the $4,000 credit limit or the one with the $20,000 credit limit:
    This is a constraint that states that the card with an APR of 11% is associated with either the $4,000 credit limit or the $20,000 credit limit, but not both. So:
    Xor([APR11 == Limit4000, APR11 == Limit20000]).

-   The card with an APR of 10% is either the card with the $4,000 credit limit or the TrustCo card:
    This is a constraint that states that the card with an APR of 10% is associated with either the $4,000 credit limit or the TrustCo card, but not both. So:
    Xor([APR10 == Limit4000, APR10 == TrustCo]).

-   The Credit Korp card has an APR 1 percent lower than the one with the $2,000 credit limit:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the APRs for the Credit Korp card and the card with the $2,000 credit limit, such that Credit Korp's APR is 1 percent lower. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    a1 == CreditKorp and a2 == Limit2000 => a1_to_int == a2_to_int - 1, for all a1, a2 in APRs.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if CreditKorp == 1, and APR8 == 1, and Limit2000 == 1, then CreditKorp has an APR of 8% and a credit limit of $2,000.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the credit cards: CreditKorp, MidAtlantic, SouthwestInc, TrustCo (all different, 1 to 4)
-   APRs of the credit cards: APR8, APR9, APR10, APR11 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Credit limits of the credit cards: Limit2000, Limit4000, Limit5000, Limit20000 (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The TrustCo card has an APR of 11%:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    TrustCo == APR11.

-   The Southwest Inc card has a limit of $2,000:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    SouthwestInc == Limit2000.

-   The card with an APR of 11% is either the card with the $4,000 credit limit or the one with the $20,000 credit limit:
    This is a constraint that states that the card with an APR of 11% is associated with either the $4,000 credit limit or the $20,000 credit limit, but not both. So:
    Xor([APR11 == Limit4000, APR11 == Limit20000]).

-   The card with an APR of 10% is either the card with the $4,000 credit limit or the TrustCo card:
    This is a constraint that states that the card with an APR of 10% is associated with either the $4,000 credit limit or the TrustCo card, but not both. So:
    Xor([APR10 == Limit4000, APR10 == TrustCo]).

-   The Credit Korp card has an APR 1 percent lower than the one with the $2,000 credit limit:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the APRs for the Credit Korp card and the card with the $2,000 credit limit, such that Credit Korp's APR is 1 percent lower. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    a1 == CreditKorp and a2 == Limit2000 => a1_to_int == a2_to_int - 1, for all a1, a2 in APRs.

Entities:
borrowers: Aimee, Ebony, Jimmy, Rosa
due dates: September 1, September 8, September 15, September 22
titles: Dancing Well, Frogs of Iowa, Heaven's Seal, Time to Burn
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Aimee == 1, and September15 == 1, and DancingWell == 1, then Aimee's book, "Dancing Well", was due on September 15.

-   Ebony's book was due 1 week after Rosa's book:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the due dates for Ebony's book and Rosa's book, such that Ebony's book's due date is 1 week after Rosa's book's due date. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    d1 == Ebony and d2 == Rosa => d1_to_int == d2_to_int + 1, for all d1, d2 in due dates.

-   Aimee's book was due on September 15:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Aimee == September15.

-   Ebony's book was "Heaven's Seal":
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Ebony == HeavensSeal.

-   "Heaven's Seal" was due 1 week after "Frogs of Iowa":
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the due dates for "Heaven's Seal" and "Frogs of Iowa", such that "Heaven's Seal"'s due date is 1 week after "Frogs of Iowa"'s due date. So, the constraints will be of the form:

The siren released in 1997 is 10 decibels louder than the siren released in 1996.
The siren released in 2009 is either the Armor-Stop or the Viking 5.
The siren released in 1997 is either the Soundarm or the Viking 5.
The Armor-Stop is louder than the siren released in 2009.
The Soundarm is 110 decibels loud.

Entities:
sirens: Armor-Stop, Rip Tide, Soundarm, Viking 5
decibels: 100 decibels, 105 decibels, 110 decibels, 115 decibels
years: 1996, 1997, 2000, 2009
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same quartet. For example, if ArmorStop == 1, and Decibels100 == 1, and Year1996 == 1, then Armor-Stop was released in 1996 and has a loudness of 100 decibels.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the sirens: Armor-Stop, RipTide, Soundarm, Viking5 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Loudness of the sirens: Decibels100, Decibels105, Decibels110, Decibels115 (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:

    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of loudness to the sirens released in 1996 and 1997, such that the siren released in 1997 is 10 decibels louder than the siren released in 1996. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    d1 == Year1996 and d2 == Year1997 => d2_to_int == d1_to_int + 10, for all d1, d2 in decibels.

-   The siren released in 2009 is either the Armor-Stop or the Viking 5:
    This is a constraint that states that the siren released in 2009 is either the Armor-Stop or the Viking 5, but not both. Thus:
    Xor([Year2009 == ArmorStop, Year2009 == Viking5]).

-   The siren released in 1997 is either the Soundarm or the Viking 5:
    This is a constraint that states that the siren released in 1997 is either the Soundarm or the Viking 5, but not both. Thus:
    Xor([Year1997 == Soundarm, Year1997 == Viking5]).

-   The Armor-Stop is louder than the siren released in 2009:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of loudness to the Armor-Stop and the siren released in 2009, such that the Armor-Stop is louder. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    d1 == ArmorStop and d2 == Year2009 => d1_to_int > d2_to_int, for all d1, d2 in decibels.

-   The Soundarm is 110 decibels loud:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Soundarm == Decibels110.
### Plan:

    This is a constraint that states that the siren released in 2009 is either the Armor-Stop or the Viking 5, but not both. Thus:

Clues:
The ring with the aquamarine cost less than the piece with the diamond.
Opal's ring is either the piece that cost $1300 or the piece with the diamond.
The piece that cost $1400 is either the ring with the ruby or Hazel's ring.
Hazel's ring has the diamond.
Becky's piece cost more than the ring with the diamond.

Entities:
customers: Becky, Hazel, Opal, Yolanda
prices: $1100, $1200, $1300, $1400
stones: aquamarine, diamond, ruby, topaz
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same quartet. For example, if Becky == 1, and $1100 == 1, and aquamarine == 1, then Becky's piece cost $1100 and has an aquamarine stone.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the customers: Becky, Hazel, Opal, Yolanda (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Prices of the pieces: Price1100, Price1200, Price1300, Price1400 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Stones in the pieces: aquamarine, diamond, ruby, topaz (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The ring with the aquamarine cost less than the piece with the diamond:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of prices for the aquamarine ring and the diamond piece, such that the aquamarine ring's price is less than the diamond piece's price. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == aquamarine and p2 == diamond => p1_to_int < p2_to_int, for all p1, p2 in prices.

-   Opal's ring is either the piece that cost $1300 or the piece with the diamond:
    This is a constraint that states that Opal's ring is either associated with the price of $1300 or has a diamond stone, but not both. So:
    Xor([Opal == Price1300, Opal == diamond]).

-   The piece that cost $1400 is either the ring with the ruby or Hazel's ring:
    This is a constraint that states that the piece with the price of $1400 is either associated with the ruby stone or belongs to Hazel, but not both. So:
    Xor([Price1400 == ruby, Price1400 == Hazel]).

-   Hazel's ring has the diamond:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Hazel == diamond.

-   Becky's piece cost more than the ring with the diamond:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of prices for Becky's piece and the diamond ring, such that Becky's piece's price is greater than the diamond ring's price. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Becky and p2 == diamond => p1_to_int > p2_to_int, for all p1, p2 in prices.
### Plan:

    Xor([Opal == Price1300, Opal == diamond]).

-   The piece that cost $1400 is either the ring with the ruby or Hazel's ring:

    Xor([Price1400 == ruby, Price1400 == Hazel]).

-   Hazel's ring has the diamond:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Hazel == diamond.

-   Becky's piece cost more than the ring with the diamond:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of prices for Becky's piece and the diamond ring, such that Becky's piece's price is greater than the diamond ring's price. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Becky and p2 == diamond => p1_to_int > p2_to_int, for all p1, p2 in prices.

The wood frog was bought 1 month after Nettie's pet.
Ollie's pet is the wood frog.
The tree frog was bought 2 months after Ollie's pet.
Joann's pet is either the wood frog or the tree frog.
Ida's pet is either the animal bought in April or the bullfrog.

Entities:
names: Ida, Joann, Nettie, Ollie
months: January, February, March, April
amphibians: bullfrog, horned toad, tree frog, wood frog
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Ida == 1, and January == 1, and Bullfrog == 1, then Ida's pet is the bullfrog bought in January.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the individuals: Ida, Joann, Nettie, Ollie (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Months of purchase: January, February, March, April (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Types of amphibians: Bullfrog, HornedToad, TreeFrog, WoodFrog (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The wood frog was bought 1 month after Nettie's pet:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months of purchase for the wood frog and Nettie's pet, such that the wood frog's purchase is 1 month after Nettie's pet's purchase. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == WoodFrog and m2 == Nettie => m1_to_int == m2_to_int + 1, for all m1, m2 in months.

-   Ollie's pet is the wood frog:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Ollie == WoodFrog.

-   The tree frog was bought 2 months after Ollie's pet:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months of purchase for the tree frog and Ollie's pet, such that the tree frog's purchase is 2 months after Ollie's pet's purchase. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == TreeFrog and m2 == Ollie => m1_to_int == m2_to_int + 2, for all m1, m2 in months.

-   Joann's pet is either the wood frog or the tree frog:
    This is a constraint that states that Joann's pet is either the wood frog or the tree frog, but not both. Thus:
    Xor([Joann == WoodFrog, Joann == TreeFrog]).

-   Ida's pet is either the animal bought in April or the bullfrog:
    This is a constraint that states that Ida's pet is either the animal bought in April or the bullfrog, but not both. Thus:

    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Ollie == WoodFrog.

    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months of purchase for the tree frog and Ollie's pet, such that the tree frog's purchase is 2 months after Ollie's pet's purchase. So, the constraints will be of the form:

### Constraints:
-   Winifred spoke for a somewhat shorter time than Omar:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the lengths for Winifred and Omar, such that Winifred's length is less than Omar's length. So, the constraints will be of the form:

-   The student who gave the presentation on Nero spoke 2 minutes more than Vickie:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the lengths for the presenter on Nero and Vickie, such that the presenter on Nero's length is 2 minutes more than Vickie's length. So, the constraints will be of the form:

Clues:
The facility scheduled to go online in 2019 is either the Egert Facility or the project headed by Dr. Alvarez.
The project headed by Dr. Morgan is either the Zynga Complex or the facility scheduled to go online in 2019.
The project headed by Dr. Salinas will go online 1 year before the Egert Facility.
The project headed by Dr. Alvarez will go online sometime after the project headed by Dr. Noble.
The project headed by Dr. Salinas will go online sometime before the project headed by Dr. Noble.
The project headed by Dr. Morgan will go online sometime after the Bale-Hahn SSC.

Entities:
names: Bale-Hahn SSC, Egert Facility, Lectra 4C, Zynga Complex
years: 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019
scientists: Dr. Alvarez, Dr. Morgan, Dr. Noble, Dr. Salinas
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if BaleHahnSSC == 1, and 2016 == 1, and DrAlvarez == 1, then the Bale-Hahn SSC project, headed by Dr. Alvarez, went online in 2016.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the projects: BaleHahnSSC, EgertFacility, Lectra4C, ZyngaComplex (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Years the projects go online: Year2016, Year2017, Year2018, Year2019 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Names of the scientists: DrAlvarez, DrMorgan, DrNoble, DrSalinas (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The facility scheduled to go online in 2019 is either the Egert Facility or the project headed by Dr. Alvarez:
    This is a constraint that states that the project going online in 2019 is either the Egert Facility or the project headed by Dr. Alvarez, but not both. So:
    Xor([Year2019 == EgertFacility, Year2019 == DrAlvarez]).

-   The project headed by Dr. Morgan is either the Zynga Complex or the facility scheduled to go online in 2019:
    This is a constraint that states that the project headed by Dr. Morgan is either the Zynga Complex or the project going online in 2019, but not both. So:
    Xor([DrMorgan == ZyngaComplex, DrMorgan == Year2019]).

-   The project headed by Dr. Salinas will go online 1 year before the Egert Facility:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the years for the projects headed by Dr. Salinas and the Egert Facility, such that the project headed by Dr. Salinas goes online 1 year before the Egert Facility. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    y1 == DrSalinas and y2 == EgertFacility => y1_to_int == y2_to_int - 1, for all y1, y2 in years.

-   The project headed by Dr. Alvarez will go online sometime after the project headed by Dr. Noble:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the years for the projects headed by Dr. Alvarez and Dr. Noble, such that the project headed by Dr. Alvarez goes online after the project headed by Dr. Noble. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    y1 == DrAlvarez and y2 == DrNoble => y1_to_int > y2_to_int, for all y1, y2 in years.

    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the years for the projects headed by Dr. Salinas and Dr. Noble, such that the project headed by Dr. Salinas goes online before the project headed by Dr. Noble. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    y1 == DrSalinas and y2 == DrNoble => y1_to_int < y2_to_int, for all y1, y2 in years.

Clues:
Lillian scored 6 points higher than Bessie.
The dancer who performed first scored 3 points lower than the dancer who performed ninth.
Verna scored somewhat higher than the person who danced third.
The dancer who performed seventh scored 6 points higher than the person who danced ninth.

Entities:
names: Bessie, Clara, Lillian, Verna
points: 181 points, 184 points, 187 points, 190 points
orders: first, third, seventh, ninth
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Bessie == 1, and 181points == 1, and First == 1, then Bessie is the dancer who performed first and scored 181 points.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the dancers: Bessie, Clara, Lillian, Verna (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Points scored by the dancers: Points181, Points184, Points187, Points190 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Orders of the performances: First, Third, Seventh, Ninth (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   Lillian scored 6 points higher than Bessie:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of points for Lillian and Bessie, such that Lillian's points are 6 points higher than Bessie's points. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Lillian and p2 == Bessie => p1_to_int == p2_to_int + 6, for all p1, p2 in points.

-   The dancer who performed first scored 3 points lower than the dancer who performed ninth:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of points for the first and ninth performers, such that the first performer's points are 3 points lower than the ninth performer's points. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == First and p2 == Ninth => p1_to_int == p2_to_int - 3, for all p1, p2 in points.

-   Verna scored somewhat higher than the person who danced third:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of points for Verna and the third performer, such that Verna's points are higher than the third performer's points. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Verna and p2 == Third => p1_to_int > p2_to_int, for all p1, p2 in points.

-   The dancer who performed seventh scored 6 points higher than the person who danced ninth:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of points for the seventh and ninth performers, such that the seventh performer's points are 6 points higher than the ninth performer's points. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Seventh and p2 == Ninth => p1_to_int == p2_to_int + 6, for all p1, p2 in points.

For example, if Ebony == 1, and 200 == 1, and 225 == 1, then Ebony's project is the book published in 2007 and is 225 pages long.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the translators: Ebony, Jan, Orlando, Suzanne (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Number of pages in the projects: Pages150, Pages175, Pages200, Pages225 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Years of publication: Year2002, Year2007, Year2010, Year2011 (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The 200 page project is either the book published in 2011 or the book published in 2010:
    This is a constraint that states that the 200-page project is either from 2011 or 2010, but not both. So:
    Xor([Pages200 == Year2011, Pages200 == Year2010]).

-   The book published in 2011 is either Orlando's project or Jan's project:
    This is a constraint that states that the book published in 2011 is either Orlando's or Jan's project, but not both. So:
    Xor([Year2011 == Orlando, Year2011 == Jan]).

-   The book published in 2007 is 25 pages shorter than the book published in 2002:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the number of pages for the books published in 2007 and 2002, such that the book published in 2007 is 25 pages shorter than the book published in 2002. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Year2007 and p2 == Year2002 => p2_to_int == p1_to_int + 25, for all p1, p2 in pages.

-   The four projects are the book published in 2007, the 225 page assignment, Suzanne's project, and the 175 page assignment:
    This is a constraint that states that all these entities are different, thus:
    AllDifferent([Year2007, Pages225, Suzanne, Pages175]).

-   Jan's assignment is 175 pages long:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Jan == Pages175.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same quartet.

    This is a constraint that states that the 200-page project is either from 2011 or 2010, but not both. So:
    Xor([Pages200 == Year2011, Pages200 == Year2010]).

-   The book published in 2011 is either Orlando's project or Jan's project:
    This is a constraint that states that the book published in 2011 is either Orlando's or Jan's project, but not both. So:
    Xor([Year2011 == Orlando, Year2011 == Jan]).

-   The book published in 2007 is 25 pages shorter than the book published in 2002:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the number of pages for the books published in 2007 and 2002, such that the book published in 2007 is 25 pages shorter than the book published in 2002. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Year2007 and p2 == Year2002 => p2_to_int == p1_to_int + 25, for all p1, p2 in pages.

-   The four projects are the book published in 2007, the 225 page assignment, Suzanne's project, and the 175 page assignment:
    This is a constraint that states that all these entities are different, thus:
    AllDifferent([Year2007, Pages225, Suzanne, Pages175]).

-   Jan's assignment is 175 pages long:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Jan == Pages175.

Clues:
Mrs. Danielson's cake will be delivered 1 day before the order shaped like a sports car.
The order shaped like a turtle will be delivered 2 days before Mrs. Ingram's cake.
The cake shaped like a bowling pin is either the October 5 delivery or Mrs. Ingram's cake.
Mrs. Nolan's cake will be in the shape of a sports car.
The October 7 delivery will be in the shape of a bowling pin.

Entities:
customers: Danielson, Estrada, Ingram, Nolan
delivery dates: October 5, October 6, October 7, October 8
cake shapes: baseball glove, bowling pin, sports car, turtle
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Danielson == 1, and October5 == 1, and BaseballGlove == 1, then Mrs. Danielson's cake will be delivered on October 5 in the shape of a baseball glove.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the customers: Danielson, Estrada, Ingram, Nolan (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Delivery dates: October5, October6, October7, October8 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Cake shapes: BaseballGlove, BowlingPin, SportsCar, Turtle (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   Mrs. Danielson's cake will be delivered 1 day before the order shaped like a sports car:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the delivery dates for Mrs. Danielson's cake and the sports car-shaped order, such that Mrs. Danielson's cake is delivered 1 day before the sports car-shaped order. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    d1 == Danielson and d2 == SportsCar => d1_to_int == d2_to_int - 1, for all d1, d2 in delivery dates.

-   The order shaped like a turtle will be delivered 2 days before Mrs. Ingram's cake:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the delivery dates for the turtle-shaped order and Mrs. Ingram's cake, such that the turtle-shaped order is delivered 2 days before Mrs. Ingram's cake. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    d1 == Turtle and d2 == Ingram => d1_to_int == d2_to_int - 2, for all d1, d2 in delivery dates.

-   The cake shaped like a bowling pin is either the October 5 delivery or Mrs. Ingram's cake:
    This is a constraint that states that the cake shaped like a bowling pin is either delivered on October 5 or is Mrs. Ingram's cake, but not both. So:
    Xor([BowlingPin == October5, BowlingPin == Ingram]).

-   Mrs. Nolan's cake will be in the shape of a sports car:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Nolan == SportsCar.

-   The October 7 delivery will be in the shape of a bowling pin:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    October7 == BowlingPin.
### Plan:

    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the delivery dates for the turtle-shaped order and Mrs. Ingram's cake, such that the turtle-shaped order is delivered 2 days before Mrs. Ingram's cake. So, the constraints will be of the form:

Of Ingram Arena and Noble Arena, one holds 150 people and the other is set up for rugby games.
The lacrosse facility holds 40 more people than Wilcox Arena.
Ingram Arena holds 230 people.
Wilcox Arena holds 80 fewer people than the soccer facility.

Entities:
arenas: Frederick, Ingram, Noble, Wilcox
capacities: 110, 150, 190, 230
sports: basketball, lacrosse, rugby, soccer
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Frederick == 1, and 110 == 1, and Basketball == 1, then Frederick is the basketball facility with a capacity of 110 people.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the arenas: Frederick, Ingram, Noble, Wilcox (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Capacities of the arenas: Capacity110, Capacity150, Capacity190, Capacity230 (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   Of Ingram Arena and Noble Arena, one holds 150 people and the other is set up for rugby games:
    This is a constraint that states that one of Ingram Arena or Noble Arena holds 150 people and the other is set up for rugby games. So, the constraints will be:
    (Ingram == Capacity150 and Noble == Rugby) or (Ingram == Rugby and Noble == Capacity150).

-   The lacrosse facility holds 40 more people than Wilcox Arena:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of capacities for the lacrosse facility and Wilcox Arena, such that the lacrosse facility's capacity is 40 more than Wilcox Arena's capacity. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    c1 == Lacrosse and c2 == Wilcox => c1_to_int == c2_to_int + 40, for all c1, c2 in capacities.

-   Ingram Arena holds 230 people:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:

### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing.

    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of capacities for the lacrosse facility and Wilcox Arena, such that the lacrosse facility's capacity is 40 more than Wilcox Arena's capacity. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    c1 == Lacrosse and c2 == Wilcox => c1_to_int == c2_to_int + 40, for all c1, c2 in capacities.

For example, if Gillespie == 1, and 110sqft == 1, and Price35000 == 1, then Gillespie's structure is 110 sq ft and sold for $35,000.

### Decision variables:

-   Prices of the homes: Price25000, Price29000, Price35000, Price36000 (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The $35,000 structure is 15 sq ft smaller than the $29,000 home:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of prices for the $35,000 structure and the $29,000 home, such that the $35,000 structure is 15 sq ft smaller than the $29,000 home. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Price35000 and p2 == Price29000 => p1_to_int == p2_to_int - 15, for all p1, p2 in sq footage.

-   The Whitehead's structure sold for $29,000:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Whitehead == Price29000.

-   The Kirby's house is 15 sq ft smaller than the $35,000 house:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of square footage for the Kirby's house and the $35,000 house, such that the Kirby's house is 15 sq ft smaller than the $35,000 house. So, the constraints will be of the form:

-   The $36,000 house is somewhat smaller than the Gillespie's structure:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of prices for the $36,000 house and the Gillespie's structure, such that the $36,000 house is somewhat smaller than the Gillespie's structure. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Price36000 and p2 == Gillespie => p1_to_int < p2_to_int, for all p1, p2 in sq footage.

-   Of the 110 sq ft home and the 140 sq ft home, one sold for $35,000 and the other is for the Gillespies:
    This is a constraint that states that for the 110 sq ft home and the 140 sq ft home, one is associated with $35,000 and the other with the Gillespies, but not both. So:
    Xor([
        (SqFt110 == Price35000, SqFt110 == Gillespie),

### Plan:

    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of square footage for the Kirby's house and the $35,000 house, such that the Kirby's house is 15 sq ft smaller than the $35,000 house. So, the constraints will be of the form:

    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of prices for the $36,000 house and the Gillespie's structure, such that the $36,000 house is somewhat smaller than the Gillespie's structure. So, the constraints will be of the form:

### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Nielsen == 1, and 95sqft == 1, and Price27500 == 1, then Nielsen's house is 95 sq ft and sold for $27,500.

### Decision variables:

    This is a constraint that states that the 125 sq ft home is either the Whitehead's home or the $32,250 home, but not both. So:
    Xor([SqFt125 == Whitehead, SqFt125 == Price32250]).

    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Whitehead == Price29000.

    This is a direct assignment constraint:

-   Klein had 9 goals this season:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:

-   The player from the Checkers scored 1 goal more than Walls:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of goals for the Checkers and Walls, such that the Checkers' goals are 1 more than Walls' goals. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    g1 == Checkers and g2 == Walls => g1_to_int == g2_to_int + 1, for all g1, g2 in goals.

Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Klein == 1, and Goals9 == 1, and Checkers == 1, then Klein scored 9 goals this season and is from the Checkers.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the players: Klein, Underwood, Walls, Zimmerman (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Number of goals scored: Goals6, Goals7, Goals8, Goals9 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Names of the teams: Checkers, Comets, IceHogs, Wolverines (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   Zimmerman is from the Wolverines:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Zimmerman == Wolverines.

-   The person from the Ice Hogs scored 1 goal less than the player from the Wolverines:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of goals for the Ice Hogs and the Wolverines, such that the Ice Hogs' goals are 1 less than the Wolverines' goals. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    g1 == IceHogs and g2 == Wolverines => g1_to_int == g2_to_int - 1, for all g1, g2 in goals.

-   Klein had 9 goals this season:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Klein == Goals9.

-   The player from the Checkers scored 1 goal more than Walls:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of goals for the Checkers and Walls, such that the Checkers' goals are 1 more than Walls' goals. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    g1 == Checkers and g2 == Walls => g1_to_int == g2_to_int + 1, for all g1, g2 in goals.

Clues:
Of the bird bought in February and the bird bought in January, one is Gladys's and the other is the macaw.
The macaw was bought 2 months before Ellen's pet.
The parakeet was bought 1 month after the finch.
Alberta's pet was bought 1 month before Gladys's pet.
The finch was bought sometime after the lovebird.

Entities:
names: Alberta, Della, Ellen, Gladys
months: January, February, March, April
birds: finch, lovebird, macaw, parakeet
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Alberta == 1, and January == 1, and Finch == 1, then Alberta's pet, a finch, was bought in January.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the owners: Alberta, Della, Ellen, Gladys (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Months of purchase: January, February, March, April (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Types of birds: Finch, Lovebird, Macaw, Parakeet (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   Of the bird bought in February and the bird bought in January, one is Gladys's and the other is the macaw:
    This is a constraint that states that one bird bought in February and one bird bought in January are owned by Gladys and are macaws. So:
    (February == Gladys and January == Macaw) OR (January == Gladys and February == Macaw).

-   The macaw was bought 2 months before Ellen's pet:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months for the macaw and Ellen's pet, such that the macaw was bought 2 months before Ellen's pet. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == Macaw and m2 == Ellen => m1_to_int == m2_to_int + 2, for all m1, m2 in months.

-   The parakeet was bought 1 month after the finch:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months for the parakeet and the finch, such that the parakeet was bought 1 month after the finch. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == Parakeet and m2 == Finch => m1_to_int == m2_to_int + 1, for all m1, m2 in months.

-   Alberta's pet was bought 1 month before Gladys's pet:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months for Alberta's pet and Gladys's pet, such that Alberta's pet was bought 1 month before Gladys's pet. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == Alberta and m2 == Gladys => m1_to_int == m2_to_int - 1, for all m1, m2 in months.

-   The finch was bought sometime after the lovebird:
    This is a constraint that states that the finch was bought after the lovebird, so:
    Finch > Lovebird.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Alberta == 1, and January == 1, and Finch == 1, then Alberta's pet, a finch, was bought in January.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the owners: Alberta, Della, Ellen, Gladys (all different, 1 to 4)

    This is a constraint that states that one bird bought in February and one bird bought in January are owned by Gladys and are macaws. So:
    (February == Gladys and January == Macaw) OR (January == Gladys and February == Macaw).

-   The macaw was bought 2 months before Ellen's pet:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months for the macaw and Ellen's pet, such that the macaw was bought 2 months before Ellen's pet. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == Macaw and m2 == Ellen => m1_to_int == m2_to_int + 2, for all m1, m2 in months.

-   The parakeet was bought 1 month after the finch:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months for the parakeet and the finch, such that the parakeet was bought 1 month after the finch. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == Parakeet and m2 == Finch => m1_to_int == m2_to_int + 1, for all m1, m2 in months.

-   Alberta's pet was bought 1 month before Gladys's pet:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months for Alberta's pet and Gladys's pet, such that Alberta's pet was bought 1 month before Gladys's pet. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == Alberta and m2 == Gladys => m1_to_int == m2_to_int - 1, for all m1, m2 in months.

-   The finch was bought sometime after the lovebird:
    This is a constraint that states that the finch was bought after the lovebird, so:
    Finch > Lovebird.

Clues:
The Tevatron LHC is either the facility scheduled to go online in 2019 or the accelerator scheduled to go online in 2016.
Of the project headed by Dr. Baldwin and the project headed by Dr. Quinn, one is the Falston LCS and the other will go online in 2017.
The project headed by Dr. Ewing will go online sometime before the Zynga Complex.
Of the project headed by Dr. Ewing and the facility scheduled to go online in 2018, one is the Egert Facility and the other is the Tevatron LHC.
The Zynga Complex is headed by Dr. Baldwin.

Entities:
names: Egert Facility, Falston LCS, Tevatron LHC, Zynga Complex
years: 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019

### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if EgertFacility == 1, and 2016 == 1, and DrBaldwin == 1, then the Egert Facility project, headed by Dr. Baldwin, will go online in 2016.

### Decision variables:

### Constraints:

    This is a constraint that states that the Tevatron LHC project is either in 2019 or in 2016, but not both. So:
    Xor([TevatronLHC == Year2019, TevatronLHC == Year2016]).

-   Of the project headed by Dr. Baldwin and the project headed by Dr. Quinn, one is the Falston LCS and the other will go online in 2017:
    This is a constraint that states that one of the projects is the Falston LCS and the other goes online in 2017, but not both. So:
    Xor([DrBaldwin == FalstonLCS, DrQuinn == FalstonLCS, DrBaldwin == Year2017, DrQuinn == Year2017]).

-   The project headed by Dr. Ewing will go online sometime before the Zynga Complex:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the years for Dr. Ewing's project and the Zynga Complex, such that Dr. Ewing's project's year is less than the Zynga Complex's year. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    y1 == DrEwing and y2 == ZyngaComplex => y1_to_int < y2_to_int, for all y1, y2 in years.

-   Of the project headed by Dr. Ewing and the facility scheduled to go online in 2018, one is the Egert Facility and the other is the Tevatron LHC:
    This is a constraint that states that one of the projects is the Egert Facility and the other goes online in 2018, but not both. So:
    Xor([DrEwing == EgertFacility, Year2018 == EgertFacility, DrEwing == TevatronLHC, Year2018 == TevatronLHC]).

-   The Zynga Complex is headed by Dr. Baldwin:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    ZyngaComplex == DrBaldwin.

Clues:
The 2004 holiday is either the skydiving holiday or the holiday with Yvonne.
Of the kayaking holiday and the trip with Isabel, one was in 2001 and the other was in 2004.
The vacation with Andy was after the trip with Yvonne.
The holiday with Bill was 1 year after the trip with Andy.
The cycling trip was before the hunting vacation.

Entities:
friends: Andy, Bill, Isabel, Yvonne
years: 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004
activities: cycling, hunting, kayaking, skydiving
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Andy == 1, and Year2001 == 1, and Cycling == 1, then Andy went cycling in 2001.

### Decision variables:

### Constraints:
-   The 2004 holiday is either the skydiving holiday or the holiday with Yvonne:
    This is a constraint that states that the 2004 holiday is either the skydiving holiday or the holiday with Yvonne, but not both. So:
    Xor([Year2004 == Skydiving, Year2004 == Yvonne]).

-   Of the kayaking holiday and the trip with Isabel, one was in 2001 and the other was in 2004:
    This is a constraint that states that one of the kayaking holiday and the trip with Isabel was in 2001 and the other was in 2004. So, we need to add constraints to ensure that:
    - If Kayaking is in 2001, then Isabel is in 2004, and vice versa:
    (Kayaking == Year2001) == (Isabel == Year2004).

-   The vacation with Andy was after the trip with Yvonne:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of years for the vacation with Andy and the trip with Yvonne, such that Andy's vacation year is after Yvonne's trip year. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    y1 == Andy and y2 == Yvonne => y1_to_int > y2_to_int, for all y1, y2 in years.

-   The holiday with Bill was 1 year after the trip with Andy:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of years for the holiday with Bill and the trip with Andy, such that Bill's holiday year is 1 year after Andy's trip year. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    y1 == Bill and y2 == Andy => y1_to_int == y2_to_int + 1, for all y1, y2 in years.

-   The cycling trip was before the hunting vacation:
    This is a constraint that states that the cycling trip was before the hunting vacation. So, we need to add a constraint to ensure that the year of the cycling trip is less than the year of the hunting vacation:
    Cycling < Hunting.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Andy == 1, and Year2001 == 1, and Cycling == 1, then Andy went cycling in 2001.

-   Activities of the holidays: Cycling, Hunting, Kayaking, Skydiving (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The 2004 holiday is either the skydiving holiday or the holiday with Yvonne:
    This is a constraint that states that the 2004 holiday is either the skydiving holiday or the holiday with Yvonne, but not both. So:
    Xor([Year2004 == Skydiving, Year2004 == Yvonne]).

-   Of the kayaking holiday and the trip with Isabel, one was in 2001 and the other was in 2004:
    This is a constraint that states that one of the kayaking holiday and the trip with Isabel was in 2001 and the other was in 2004. So, we need to add constraints to ensure that:
    - If Kayaking is in 2001, then Isabel is in 2004, and vice versa:
    (Kayaking == Year2001) == (Isabel == Year2004).

-   The vacation with Andy was after the trip with Yvonne:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of years for the vacation with Andy and the trip with Yvonne, such that Andy's vacation year is after Yvonne's trip year. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    y1 == Andy and y2 == Yvonne => y1_to_int > y2_to_int, for all y1, y2 in years.

-   The holiday with Bill was 1 year after the trip with Andy:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of years for the holiday with Bill and the trip with Andy, such that Bill's holiday year is 1 year after Andy's trip year. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    y1 == Bill and y2 == Andy => y1_to_int == y2_to_int + 1, for all y1, y2 in years.

-   The cycling trip was before the hunting vacation:
    This is a constraint that states that the cycling trip was before the hunting vacation. So, we need to add a constraint to ensure that the year of the cycling trip is less than the year of the hunting vacation:

Clues:
Ginger was either the person who paid $160 or Vicki's client.
Beulah paid 10 dollars more than Yvonne's client.
Hannah paid less than Debra.
Vicki's client paid more than Debra.
Debra paid less than Pam's client.

Entities:
clients: Beulah, Debra, Ginger, Hannah
prices: $150, $160, $170, $180
masseuses: Lynda, Pam, Vicki, Yvonne
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Beulah == 1, and Price150 == 1, and Lynda == 1, then Beulah paid $150 to Lynda.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the clients: Beulah, Debra, Ginger, Hannah (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Prices paid by the clients: Price150, Price160, Price170, Price180 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Names of the masseuses: Lynda, Pam, Vicki, Yvonne (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   Ginger was either the person who paid $160 or Vicki's client:
    This is a constraint that states that Ginger's price is either $160 or she is Vicki's client, but not both. So:
    Xor([Ginger == Price160, Ginger == Vicki]).

-   Beulah paid 10 dollars more than Yvonne's client:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of prices for Beulah and Yvonne's client, such that Beulah's price is 10 dollars more than Yvonne's client's price. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Beulah and p2 == Yvonne => p1_to_int == p2_to_int + 10, for all p1, p2 in prices.

-   Hannah paid less than Debra:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of prices for Hannah and Debra, such that Hannah's price is less than Debra's price. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Hannah and p2 == Debra => p1_to_int < p2_to_int, for all p1, p2 in prices.

-   Vicki's client paid more than Debra:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of prices for Vicki's client and Debra, such that Vicki's client's price is more than Debra's price. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Vicki and p2 == Debra => p1_to_int > p2_to_int, for all p1, p2 in prices.

-   Debra paid less than Pam's client:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of prices for Debra and Pam's client, such that Debra's price is less than Pam's client's price. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Debra and p2 == Pam => p1_to_int < p2_to_int, for all p1, p2 in prices.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Beulah == 1, and Price150 == 1, and Lynda == 1, then Beulah paid $150 to Lynda.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the clients: Beulah, Debra, Ginger, Hannah (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Prices paid by the clients: Price150, Price160, Price170, Price180 (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   Ginger was either the person who paid $160 or Vicki's client:
    This is a constraint that states that Ginger's price is either $160 or she is Vicki's client, but not both. So:
    Xor([Ginger == Price160, Ginger == Vicki]).

-   Beulah paid 10 dollars more than Yvonne's client:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of prices for Beulah and Yvonne's client, such that Beulah's price is 10 dollars more than Yvonne's client's price. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Beulah and p2 == Yvonne => p1_to_int == p2_to_int + 10, for all p1, p2 in prices.

-   Hannah paid less than Debra:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of prices for Hannah and Debra, such that Hannah's price is less than Debra's price. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Hannah and p2 == Debra => p1_to_int < p2_to_int, for all p1, p2 in prices.

-   Vicki's client paid more than Debra:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of prices for Vicki's client and Debra, such that Vicki's client's price is more than Debra's price. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Vicki and p2 == Debra => p1_to_int > p2_to_int, for all p1, p2 in prices.

-   Debra paid less than Pam's client:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of prices for Debra and Pam's client, such that Debra's price is less than Pam's client's price. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Debra and p2 == Pam => p1_to_int < p2_to_int, for all p1, p2 in prices.
