Clues:
The person who had the port paid 1 dollar more than Kurt.
Of the person who paid $25 and the person who paid $24, one was Priscilla and the other had the shiraz.
Of the person who paid $27 and Priscilla, one had the chianti and the other had the port.
Isabel paid $25.

Entities:
wines: chianti, port, riesling, shiraz
prices: $24, $25, $26, $27
names: Isabel, Kurt, Priscilla, Robin
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Isabel == 1, and $25 == 1, and Chianti == 1, then Isabel paid $25 for the Chianti.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the persons: Isabel, Kurt, Priscilla, Robin (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Prices paid by the persons: Price24, Price25, Price26, Price27 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Wines ordered by the persons: Chianti, Port, Riesling, Shiraz (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The person who had the port paid 1 dollar more than Kurt:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the prices for Kurt and the person who had the port, such that the person who had the port paid 1 dollar more than Kurt. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Kurt and p2 == Port => p2_to_int == p1_to_int + 1, for all p1, p2 in prices.

-   Of the person who paid $25 and the person who paid $24, one was Priscilla and the other had the shiraz:
    This is a constraint that states that one person paid $25 and had the shiraz, and the other person paid $24 and was Priscilla. So:
    (Price25 == Priscilla and Shiraz == Price24) or (Price24 == Priscilla and Shiraz == Price25).

-   Of the person who paid $27 and Priscilla, one had the chianti and the other had the port:
    This is a constraint that states that one person paid $27 and had the chianti, and the other person was Priscilla and had the port. So:
    (Price27 == Chianti and Priscilla == Port) or (Price27 == Port and Priscilla == Chianti).

-   Isabel paid $25:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Isabel == Price25.

-   All entities are different:
    This is a constraint that states that all entities (prices, wines, names) are different:
    AllDifferent([Price24, Price25, Price26, Price27, Chianti, Port, Riesling, Shiraz, Isabel, Kurt, Priscilla, Robin]).
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Isabel == 1, and $25 == 1, and Chianti == 1, then Isabel paid $25 for the Chianti.

    p1 == Kurt and p2 == Port => p2_to_int == p1_to_int + 1, for all p1, p2 in prices.

-   Of the person who paid $25 and the person who paid $24, one was Priscilla and the other had the shiraz:
    This is a constraint that states that one person paid $25 and had the shiraz, and the other person paid $24 and was Priscilla. So:
    (Price25 == Priscilla and Shiraz == Price24) or (Price24 == Priscilla and Shiraz == Price25).

-   Of the person who paid $27 and Priscilla, one had the chianti and the other had the port:
    This is a constraint that states that one person paid $27 and had the chianti, and the other person was Priscilla and had the port. So:
    (Price27 == Chianti and Priscilla == Port) or (Price27 == Port and Priscilla == Chianti).

-   Isabel paid $25:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Isabel == Price25.

-   All entities are different:
    This is a constraint that states that all entities (prices, wines, names) are different:
    AllDifferent([Price24, Price25, Price26, Price27, Chianti, Port, Riesling, Shiraz, Isabel, Kurt, Priscilla, Robin]).

Mandy lost 2 fewer pounds than Raymond.
Mandy lost 4 more pounds than Tom.
The dieter who used the vegan diet is either Mandy or the friend who lost 3 pounds.

Entities:
pounds lost: 3, 5, 7, 9
diets: dairy-free, gluten-free, low-fat, vegan
names: Celia, Mandy, Raymond, Tom
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Celia == 1, and 3 pounds == 1, and DairyFree == 1, then Celia used the dairy-free diet and lost 3 pounds.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the dieters: Celia, Mandy, Raymond, Tom (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Pounds lost by the dieters: 3, 5, 7, 9 (all different, 1 to 4)

    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Friend3Pounds == LowFat.

-   Mandy lost 2 fewer pounds than Raymond:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the pounds lost by Mandy and Raymond, such that Mandy's pounds lost is 2 fewer than Raymond's pounds lost. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Mandy and p2 == Raymond => p1_to_int == p2_to_int - 2, for all p1, p2 in pounds.

-   Mandy lost 4 more pounds than Tom:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the pounds lost by Mandy and Tom, such that Mandy's pounds lost is 4 more than Tom's pounds lost. So, the constraints will be of the form:

-   The dieter who used the vegan diet is either Mandy or the friend who lost 3 pounds:
    This is a constraint that states that the dieter who used the vegan diet is either Mandy or the friend who lost 3 pounds, but not both. So:
    Xor([Vegan == Mandy, Vegan == Friend3Pounds]).
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Celia == 1, and 3 pounds == 1, and DairyFree == 1, then Celia used the dairy-free diet and lost 3 pounds.

-   Cultures studied: Cheer, Garyk, Haleyito, Xozix (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The person who will publish in January is either the person who has been studying the Cheer culture or Ira:
    This is a constraint that states that the person publishing in January is either studying the Cheer culture or is Ira, but not both. So:
    Xor([January == Cheer, January == Ira]).

-   The person who has been studying the Xozix culture will publish 1 month before the person who has been studying the Haleyito culture:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the cultures studied by the individuals, such that the person studying Xozix will publish 1 month before the person studying Haleyito. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    c1 == Xozix and c2 == Haleyito => c1_to_int == c2_to_int - 1, for all c1, c2 in cultures studied.

-   Of the student who will publish in March and the person who has been studying the Xozix culture, one is Luther and the other is Yvette:
    This is a constraint that states that one of the individuals who will publish in March and the one studying Xozix culture is Luther and the other is Yvette, but not both. So:
    Xor([March == Luther and Xozix == Yvette, March == Yvette and Xozix == Luther]).

-   Vera will publish 1 month before Luther:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months of publication for Vera and Luther, such that Vera will publish 1 month before Luther. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == Vera and m2 == Luther => m1_to_int == m2_to_int - 1, for all m1, m2 in months of publication.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Ira == 1, and January == 1, and Cheer == 1, then Ira will publish in January after studying the Cheer culture.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the individuals: Ira, Luther, Vera, Yvette (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Months of publication: January, February, March, April (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Cultures studied: Cheer, Garyk, Haleyito, Xozix (all different, 1 to 4)

Entities:
days: June 10, June 11, June 12, June 13
names: Francis, Greg, Ira, Oscar
departures: Buttonwillow, Coulterville, Indio, Manson
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Francis == 1, and Manson == 1, and June10 == 1, then Francis will depart from Manson on June 10.

### Constraints:
-   Francis will depart from Manson:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Francis == Manson.

-   The conductor working on June 12 is either the conductor departing from Buttonwillow or Greg:
    This is a constraint that states that the conductor working on June 12 is either from Buttonwillow or Greg, but not both. So:
    Xor([June12 == Buttonwillow, June12 == Greg]).

-   Ira will leave 1 day before the conductor departing from Manson:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the departure dates for Ira and the conductor departing from Manson, such that Ira's departure date is 1 day before the conductor's departure date. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    d1 == Ira and d2 == Manson => d1_to_int == d2_to_int - 1, for all d1, d2 in dates of departure.

-   The person departing from Buttonwillow will leave 1 day before the conductor departing from Indio:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the departure dates for the person departing from Buttonwillow and the conductor departing from Indio, such that the person departing from Buttonwillow's departure date is 1 day before the conductor's departure date. So, the constraints will be of the form:

    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the departure dates for Ira and the conductor departing from Manson, such that Ira's departure date is 1 day before the conductor's departure date. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    d1 == Ira and d2 == Manson => d1_to_int == d2_to_int - 1, for all d1, d2 in dates of departure.

-   The person departing from Buttonwillow will leave 1 day before the conductor departing from Indio:

boat types: catamaran, ketch, schooner, trimaran
sailors: Debra Decker, Gil Baxter, Vicky Estes, Wendell Orr
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if VickyEstes == 1, and Catamaran == 1, and 270 == 1, then Vicky Estes used the catamaran and finished in 270 days.

-   Debra Decker took 4 fewer days to finish than the sailor in the trimaran:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the number of days for Debra Decker and the sailor in the trimaran, such that Debra Decker took 4 fewer days to finish. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    d1 == DebraDecker and d2 == Trimaran => d1_to_int == d2_to_int - 4, for all d1, d2 in days.

-   Wendell Orr finished in 278 days:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    WendellOrr == 278.

-   The competitor in the schooner took 4 more days to finish than Vicky Estes:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the number of days for the competitor in the schooner and Vicky Estes, such that the competitor in the schooner took 4 more days to finish. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    d1 == VickyEstes and d2 == Schooner => d1_to_int + 4 == d2_to_int, for all d1, d2 in days.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing.

    d1 == DebraDecker and d2 == Trimaran => d1_to_int == d2_to_int - 4, for all d1, d2 in days.

-   Wendell Orr finished in 278 days:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:

Clues:
The ambassador with the 9 day visit will leave sometime after Fitzgerald.
Quinn will leave 2 months after Bender.
The person leaving in January is either the ambassador with the 3 day visit or Fitzgerald.
Quinn will leave 1 month before the ambassador with the 7 day visit.

Entities:
diplomats: Bender, Fitzgerald, Owens, Quinn
months: January, February, March, April
durations: 2 day, 3 day, 7 day, 9 day
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Bender == 1, and January == 1, and Day2 == 1, then Bender is the diplomat leaving in January with a 2-day visit.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the diplomats: Bender, Fitzgerald, Owens, Quinn (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Months of departure: January, February, March, April (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Visit durations: Day2, Day3, Day7, Day9 (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The ambassador with the 9-day visit will leave sometime after Fitzgerald:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months of departure for the ambassador with the 9-day visit and Fitzgerald, such that the ambassador with the 9-day visit's month of departure is greater than Fitzgerald's month of departure. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == Day9 and m2 == Fitzgerald => m1_to_int > m2_to_int, for all m1, m2 in months of departure.

-   Quinn will leave 2 months after Bender:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months of departure for Quinn and Bender, such that Quinn's month of departure is 2 more than Bender's month of departure. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == Quinn and m2 == Bender => m1_to_int == m2_to_int + 2, for all m1, m2 in months of departure.

-   The person leaving in January is either the ambassador with the 3-day visit or Fitzgerald:
    This is a constraint that states that the diplomat leaving in January is either the ambassador with the 3-day visit or Fitzgerald, but not both. So:
    Xor([January == Day3, January == Fitzgerald]).

-   Quinn will leave 1 month before the ambassador with the 7-day visit:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months of departure for Quinn and the ambassador with the 7-day visit, such that Quinn's month of departure is 1 less than the 7-day ambassador's month of departure. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == Quinn and m2 == Day7 => m1_to_int == m2_to_int - 1, for all m1, m2 in months of departure.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Bender == 1, and January == 1, and Day2 == 1, then Bender is the diplomat leaving in January with a 2-day visit.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the diplomats: Bender, Fitzgerald, Owens, Quinn (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Months of departure: January, February, March, April (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Visit durations: Day2, Day3, Day7, Day9 (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The ambassador with the 9-day visit will leave sometime after Fitzgerald:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months of departure for the ambassador with the 9-day visit and Fitzgerald, such that the ambassador with the 9-day visit's month of departure is greater than Fitzgerald's month of departure. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == Day9 and m2 == Fitzgerald => m1_to_int > m2_to_int, for all m1, m2 in months of departure.

-   Quinn will leave 2 months after Bender:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months of departure for Quinn and Bender, such that Quinn's month of departure is 2 more than Bender's month of departure. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == Quinn and m2 == Bender => m1_to_int == m2_to_int + 2, for all m1, m2 in months of departure.

-   The person leaving in January is either the ambassador with the 3-day visit or Fitzgerald:
    This is a constraint that states that the diplomat leaving in January is either the ambassador with the 3-day visit or Fitzgerald, but not both. So:

-   Quinn will leave 1 month before the ambassador with the 7-day visit:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months of departure for Quinn and the ambassador with the 7-day visit, such that Quinn's month of departure is 1 less than the 7-day ambassador's month of departure. So, the constraints will be of the form:

Clues:
Ultra Hex is Gabe Grant.
Criminal Bane is either the hero who started in 2007 or the superhero who started in 2009.
Peter Powers began sometime before Matt Minkle.
Gabe Grant began 1 year after Wonderman.
The four people are Deep Shadow, the superhero who started in 2007, the hero who started in 2009 and Matt Minkle.

Entities:
years: 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010
superheroes: Criminal Bane, Deep Shadow, Ultra Hex, Wonderman
names: Gabe Grant, Ivor Ingram, Matt Minkle, Peter Powers
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same quartet. For example, if DeepShadow == 1, and 2007 == 1, and CriminalBane == 1, then Deep Shadow started in 2007 and is Criminal Bane.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the superheroes: CriminalBane, DeepShadow, UltraHex, Wonderman (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Start years of the superheroes: Year2007, Year2008, Year2009, Year2010 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Real names of the superheroes: GabeGrant, IvorIngram, MattMinkle, PeterPowers (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   Ultra Hex is Gabe Grant:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    UltraHex == GabeGrant.

-   Criminal Bane is either the hero who started in 2007 or the superhero who started in 2009:
    This is a constraint that states that Criminal Bane's start year is either 2007 or 2009, but not both. So:
    Xor([CriminalBane == Year2007, CriminalBane == Year2009]).

-   Peter Powers began sometime before Matt Minkle:
    This is a constraint that states that Peter Powers' start year is before Matt Minkle's start year. So:
    PeterPowers < MattMinkle.

-   Gabe Grant began 1 year after Wonderman:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the start years for Gabe Grant and Wonderman, such that Gabe Grant's start year is 1 year after Wonderman's start year. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    y1 == GabeGrant and y2 == Wonderman => y1_to_int == y2_to_int + 1, for all y1, y2 in years.

-   The four people are Deep Shadow, the superhero who started in 2007, the hero who started in 2009, and Matt Minkle:
    This is a constraint that states that all these entities are different, thus:
    AllDifferent([DeepShadow, Year2007, Year2009, MattMinkle]).
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same quartet. For example, if DeepShadow == 1, and 2007 == 1, and CriminalBane == 1, then Deep Shadow started in 2007 and is Criminal Bane.

-   Peter Powers began sometime before Matt Minkle:
    This is a constraint that states that Peter Powers' start year is before Matt Minkle's start year. So:
    PeterPowers < MattMinkle.

-   Gabe Grant began 1 year after Wonderman:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the start years for Gabe Grant and Wonderman, such that Gabe Grant's start year is 1 year after Wonderman's start year. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    y1 == GabeGrant and y2 == Wonderman => y1_to_int == y2_to_int + 1, for all y1, y2 in years.

-   The Laneplex interview is on August 20th:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Laneplex == August20.

-   The meeting for the copywriter position is 2 days before the meeting for the web developer position:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the dates for the copywriter meeting and the web developer meeting, such that the copywriter meeting date is 2 days before the web developer meeting date. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    d1 == Copywriter and d2 == WebDeveloper => d1_to_int == d2_to_int - 2, for all d1, d2 in days.

-   Months of departure: January, February, March, April (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Types of lucky charms: Coin, LuckyHat, RabbitsFoot, Talisman (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   Of Sophie and Gwen, one will bring their rabbit's foot and the other will leave in January:
    This is a constraint that states that Sophie and Gwen have different lucky charms and leave in different months. So:
    AllDifferent([Sophie, Gwen, RabbitsFoot, January]).

-   Sophie will leave sometime before Gwen:
    This is a constraint that states that Sophie will leave before Gwen. So:
    Sophie < Gwen.

-   The passenger with the lucky hat, Gwen, and Sophie are all different fliers:
    This is a constraint that states that the fliers with the lucky hat, Gwen, and Sophie are all different. So:
    AllDifferent([LuckyHat, Gwen, Sophie]).

-   Florence will leave 2 months after the passenger with the lucky hat:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months of departure for Florence and the passenger with the lucky hat, such that Florence's month of departure is 2 more than the lucky hat's month of departure. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == Florence and m2 == LuckyHat => m1_to_int == m2_to_int + 2, for all m1, m2 in months of departure.

-   The passenger leaving in April is either Gwen or the passenger with the talisman:
    This is a constraint that states that the passenger leaving in April is either Gwen or the one with the talisman, but not both. So:
    Xor([April == Gwen, April == Talisman]).
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Florence == 1, and January == 1, and Coin == 1, then Florence is the passenger leaving in January with the coin.

### Decision variables:

The Iunsel launched in February.
The Munei is going to Mars.
The Munei launched 1 month after the mission going to Pluto.

Entities:
months: January, February, March, April
probes: Ateyin, Chano, Iunsel, Munei
destinations: Ganymede, Mars, Pluto, Uranus
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Ateyin == 1, and January == 1, and Ganymede == 1, then Ateyin is the probe that is going to Ganymede and will launch in January.

-   The Munei is going to Mars:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:

-   The Munei launched 1 month after the mission going to Pluto:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months of launch for the Munei and the mission going to Pluto, such that Munei's month of launch is 1 month after the mission going to Pluto's month of launch. So, the constraints will be of the form:

-   Of the mission going to Ganymede and the mission going to Pluto, one launched in March and the other is the Chano:
    This is a constraint that states that for the mission going to Ganymede and the mission going to Pluto, one is associated with March and the other with Chano, but not both. So:

Clues:
The blue topaz sold for 10 dollars more than the gem found in the Osborne claim.
The rhodolite went for $820.
The tourmaline is either the gem that sold for $810 or the gem found in the Underwood claim.
Of the gem found in the Collins claim and the aquamarine, one went for $790 and the other went for $800.

Entities:
prices: $790, $800, $810, $820
gems: aquamarine, blue topaz, rhodolite, tourmaline
claims: Collins, Knox, Osborne, Underwood
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if $790 == 1, and aquamarine == 1, and Collins == 1, then the gem found in the Collins claim went for $790 and is an aquamarine.

### Decision variables:

-   Names of the claims: Collins, Knox, Osborne, Underwood (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The blue topaz sold for 10 dollars more than the gem found in the Osborne claim:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the prices for the blue topaz and the gem found in the Osborne claim, such that the blue topaz's price is 10 dollars more than the gem found in the Osborne claim. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == BlueTopaz and p2 == Osborne => p1_to_int == p2_to_int + 10, for all p1, p2 in prices.

-   The rhodolite went for $820:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Rhodolite == Price820.

-   The tourmaline is either the gem that sold for $810 or the gem found in the Underwood claim:
    This is a constraint that states that the tourmaline's price is either $810 or the gem found in the Underwood claim, but not both. So:
    Xor([Tourmaline == Price810, Tourmaline == Underwood]).

-   Of the gem found in the Collins claim and the aquamarine, one went for $790 and the other went for $800:
    This is a constraint that states that the gem found in the Collins claim's price is either $790 or $800, and the aquamarine's price is the other one, but not both. So:
    Xor([Collins == Price790 and Aquamarine == Price800, Collins == Price800 and Aquamarine == Price790]).
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing.

    Rhodolite == Price820.

-   The tourmaline is either the gem that sold for $810 or the gem found in the Underwood claim:
    This is a constraint that states that the tourmaline's price is either $810 or the gem found in the Underwood claim, but not both. So:

events: anniversary, birthday, graduation, wedding
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Herbert == 1, and 50 == 1, and Anniversary == 1, then Herbert's assignment is the anniversary event with 50 attendees.

### Constraints:
-   Of the anniversary event and the event with 100 attendees, one will be handled by Joel and the other will be handled by Susan:
    This is a constraint that states that Joel will handle one of the events (anniversary or with 100 attendees) and Susan will handle the other. So:
    Xor([Anniversary == Joel, People100 == Joel]) and Xor([Anniversary == Susan, People100 == Susan]).

-   Herbert's assignment will involve 25 fewer people than Susan's assignment:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the number of people for Herbert's assignment and Susan's assignment, such that Herbert's assignment involves 25 fewer people than Susan's assignment. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Herbert and p2 == Susan => p1_to_int == p2_to_int - 25, for all p1, p2 in people.

-   Of the assignment with 75 attendees and the assignment with 100 attendees, one will be handled by Susan and the other is the birthday:
    This is a constraint that states that Susan will handle one of the events (with 75 or 100 attendees) and the other event will be the birthday. So:
    Xor([People75 == Susan, People100 == Susan]) and Birthday == Susan.

-   Herbert's event is either the event with 50 attendees or the graduation job:
    This is a constraint that states that Herbert's event is either the event with 50 attendees or the graduation job, but not both. So:
    Xor([People50 == Herbert, Graduation == Herbert]).
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Herbert == 1, and 50 == 1, and Anniversary == 1, then Herbert's assignment is the anniversary event with 50 attendees.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the planners: Herbert, Joel, Susan, Teresa (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Number of people attending the events: People50, People75, People100, People125 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Types of events: Anniversary, Birthday, Graduation, Wedding (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   Of the anniversary event and the event with 100 attendees, one will be handled by Joel and the other will be handled by Susan:
    This is a constraint that states that Joel will handle one of the events (anniversary or with 100 attendees) and Susan will handle the other. So:
    Xor([Anniversary == Joel, People100 == Joel]) and Xor([Anniversary == Susan, People100 == Susan]).

D. forcilitis has 500 genes.
B. mangeris was either the one sequenced by Dr. Ortiz or the organism with 750 genes.
The organism sequenced by Dr. Trujillo has 500 more genes than the bacteria sequenced by Dr. Nielsen.
Of the bacteria sequenced by Dr. Jordan and the bacteria sequenced by Dr. Trujillo, one has 1000 genes and the other is E. carolinus.

### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Bmangeris == 1, and DrOrtiz == 1, and Genes750 == 1, then B. mangeris was sequenced by Dr. Ortiz and has 750 genes.

So, the constraints will be of the form:
    y1 == DrTrujillo and y2 == DrNielsen => y1_to_int == y2_to_int + 500, for all y1, y2 in number of genes.

    This is a constraint that states that one of the bacteria sequenced by Dr. Jordan and Dr. Trujillo has 1000 genes and the other is E. carolinus. So:

-   Of Mt. Brewer and Mt. Quinn, one was climbed by Ben Beasley and the other is 470 feet tall:
    This is a constraint that states that one of Mt. Brewer or Mt. Quinn was climbed by Ben Beasley and the other is 470 feet tall. So:

Clues:
Opie Oliver's card came out in 2012.
The piece that sold for $175 came out in 1999.
Of the 2012 card and the 1987 item, one featured Mike Morales and the other sold for $275.
Neddy Norris's item sold for 50 dollars more than the 1987 card.

Entities:
prices: $125, $175, $225, $275
players: Finn Freeman, Mike Morales, Neddy Norris, Opie Oliver
years: 1974, 1987, 1999, 2012
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if FinnFreeman == 1, and $125 == 1, and 1974 == 1, then Finn Freeman's item sold for $125 in 1974.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the players: FinnFreeman, MikeMorales, NeddyNorris, OpieOliver (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Prices of the items: Price125, Price175, Price225, Price275 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Years of the items: Year1974, Year1987, Year1999, Year2012 (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   Opie Oliver's card came out in 2012:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    OpieOliver == Year2012.

-   The piece that sold for $175 came out in 1999:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Price175 == Year1999.

-   Of the 2012 card and the 1987 item, one featured Mike Morales and the other sold for $275:
    This is a constraint that states that one of the items is from 2012 and features Mike Morales, and the other item is from 1987 and sold for $275. So:
    (Year2012 == MikeMorales and Price275 == Year1987) or (Year2012 == Price275 and Year1987 == MikeMorales).

-   Neddy Norris's item sold for 50 dollars more than the 1987 card:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the prices for Neddy Norris and the 1987 card, such that Neddy Norris's price is $50 more than the 1987 card's price. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == NeddyNorris and p2 == Year1987 => p1_to_int == p2_to_int + 50, for all p1, p2 in prices.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if FinnFreeman == 1, and $125 == 1, and 1974 == 1, then Finn Freeman's item sold for $125 in 1974.

    This is a constraint that states that one of the items is from 2012 and features Mike Morales, and the other item is from 1987 and sold for $275. So:
    (Year2012 == MikeMorales and Price275 == Year1987) or (Year2012 == Price275 and Year1987 == MikeMorales).

-   Neddy Norris's item sold for 50 dollars more than the 1987 card:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the prices for Neddy Norris and the 1987 card, such that Neddy Norris's price is $50 more than the 1987 card's price. So, the constraints will be of the form:

Entities:
scores: 42, 49, 56, 63
chefs: Karl, Nelson, Peggy, Rosalie
dishes: cajun chili, cashew tofu, lemon snapper, smoked pork
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Karl == 1, and 42points == 1, and CajunChili == 1, then Karl scored 42 points and made the cajun chili.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the chefs: Karl, Nelson, Peggy, Rosalie (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Scores of the chefs: Points42, Points49, Points56, Points63 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Dishes made by the chefs: CajunChili, CashewTofu, LemonSnapper, SmokedPork (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   Of Nelson and the cook who scored 63 points, one made the lemon snapper and the other made the cajun chili:
    This is a constraint that states that for Nelson and the cook who scored 63 points, one made the lemon snapper and the other made the cajun chili, but not both. So:
    Xor([
        (Nelson == LemonSnapper, Points63 == CajunChili),
        (Nelson == CajunChili, Points63 == LemonSnapper)
    ]).

-   Of the chef who scored 42 points and the cook who scored 63 points, one made the cashew tofu and the other was Rosalie:
    This is a constraint that states that for the chef who scored 42 points and the cook who scored 63 points, one made the cashew tofu and the other was Rosalie, but not both. So:
    Xor([
        (Points42 == CashewTofu, Points63 == Rosalie),
        (Points42 == Rosalie, Points63 == CashewTofu)
    ]).

-   Karl scored 7 more points than the person who made the lemon snapper:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the scores for Karl and the chef who made the lemon snapper, such that Karl's score is 7 points more than the chef who made the lemon snapper. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    s1 == Karl and s2 == LemonSnapper => s1_to_int == s2_to_int + 7, for all s1, s2 in scores.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Karl == 1, and 42points == 1, and CajunChili == 1, then Karl scored 42 points and made the cajun chili.

Clues:
Alejandro's purchase cost less than Irma's purchase.
The insect that sold for $90 was either the atlas butterfly or the emperor butterfly.
The peacock butterfly cost more than Irma's purchase.
Of Alejandro's purchase and Irma's purchase, one was the emperor butterfly and the other sold for $45.
The four butterflies were Phillip's purchase, the insect that sold for $60, the butterfly that sold for $45 and the butterfly that sold for $90.

Entities:
prices: $45, $60, $75, $90
winners: Alejandro, Faye, Irma, Phillip
butterflies: atlas, emperor, grayling, peacock
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Alejandro == 1, and $90 == 1, and atlas == 1, then Alejandro purchased the atlas butterfly for $90.

### Decision variables:

-   Prices of the butterflies: Price45, Price60, Price75, Price90 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Types of butterflies: Atlas, Emperor, Grayling, Peacock (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   Alejandro's purchase cost less than Irma's purchase:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the prices for Alejandro's purchase and Irma's purchase, such that Alejandro's purchase price is less than Irma's purchase price. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Alejandro and p2 == Irma => p1_to_int < p2_to_int, for all p1, p2 in prices.

-   The insect that sold for $90 was either the atlas butterfly or the emperor butterfly:
    This is a constraint that states that the butterfly that sold for $90 is either the atlas butterfly or the emperor butterfly, but not both. So:
    Xor([Price90 == Atlas, Price90 == Emperor]).

-   The peacock butterfly cost more than Irma's purchase:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the prices for the peacock butterfly and Irma's purchase, such that the peacock butterfly's price is more than Irma's purchase price. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Peacock and p2 == Irma => p1_to_int > p2_to_int, for all p1, p2 in prices.

-   Of Alejandro's purchase and Irma's purchase, one was the emperor butterfly and the other sold for $45:
    This is a constraint that states that one of Alejandro's purchase and Irma's purchase was the emperor butterfly and the other sold for $45, but not both. So:
    Xor([Alejandro == Emperor and Irma == Price45, Alejandro == Price45 and Irma == Emperor]).

-   The four butterflies were Phillip's purchase, the insect that sold for $60, the butterfly that sold for $45, and the butterfly that sold for $90:
    This is a constraint that states that all these entities are different, thus:

### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Alejandro == 1, and $90 == 1, and atlas == 1, then Alejandro purchased the atlas butterfly for $90.

-   Of What a World and Amerigo, one made 2 million and the other was directed by Jim Johnson:
    This is a constraint that states that one movie made 2 million and was directed by Jim Johnson, and the other movie was either What a World or Amerigo. So:
    Xor([WhatAWorld == 2 million, WhatAWorld == JimJohnson], [Amerigo == 2 million, Amerigo == JimJohnson]).

-   The film directed by Kenneth Key made 3 million less than Amerigo:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the earnings for the film directed by Kenneth Key and Amerigo, such that the film directed by Kenneth Key made 3 million less than Amerigo. So, the constraints will be of the form:

    This is a constraint that states that one movie made 2 million and was directed by Jim Johnson, and the other movie was either What a World or Amerigo. So:
    Xor([WhatAWorld == 2 million, WhatAWorld == JimJohnson], [Amerigo == 2 million, Amerigo == JimJohnson]).

-   The film directed by Kenneth Key made 3 million less than Amerigo:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the earnings for the film directed by Kenneth Key and Amerigo, such that the film directed by Kenneth Key made 3 million less than Amerigo. So, the constraints will be of the form:

Clues:
The person who is 110 years old is a native of Connecticut.
Of Arlene and the Texas native, one is 110 years old and the other is 109 years old.
Herbert is 1 year younger than Doris.
The person who is 112 years old is either Herbert or the New Mexico native.

Entities:
ages: 109 years, 110 years, 111 years, 112 years
names: Arlene, Doris, Floyd, Herbert
states: Connecticut, Missouri, New Mexico, Texas
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Arlene == 1, and Age109 == 1, and Connecticut == 1, then Arlene is 109 years old and is a native of Connecticut.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the people: Arlene, Doris, Floyd, Herbert (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Ages of the people: Age109, Age110, Age111, Age112 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   States of origin: Connecticut, Missouri, New Mexico, Texas (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The person who is 110 years old is a native of Connecticut:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Age110 == Connecticut.

-   Of Arlene and the Texas native, one is 110 years old and the other is 109 years old:
    This is a constraint that states that one of Arlene and the Texas native is 110 years old and the other is 109 years old, but not both. So:
    Xor([Arlene == Age109 and Texas == Age110, Arlene == Age110 and Texas == Age109]).

-   Herbert is 1 year younger than Doris:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the ages for Herbert and Doris, such that Herbert's age is 1 year less than Doris's age. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    a1 == Herbert and a2 == Doris => a1_to_int == a2_to_int - 1, for all a1, a2 in ages.

-   The person who is 112 years old is either Herbert or the New Mexico native:
    This is a constraint that states that the person who is 112 years old is either Herbert or the New Mexico native, but not both. So:
    Xor([Age112 == Herbert, Age112 == NewMexico]).
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Arlene == 1, and Age109 == 1, and Connecticut == 1, then Arlene is 109 years old and is a native of Connecticut.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the people: Arlene, Doris, Floyd, Herbert (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Ages of the people: Age109, Age110, Age111, Age112 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   States of origin: Connecticut, Missouri, New Mexico, Texas (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The person who is 110 years old is a native of Connecticut:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Age110 == Connecticut.

-   Of Arlene and the Texas native, one is 110 years old and the other is 109 years old:
    This is a constraint that states that one of Arlene and the Texas native is 110 years old and the other is 109 years old, but not both. So:
    Xor([Arlene == Age109 and Texas == Age110, Arlene == Age110 and Texas == Age109]).

-   Herbert is 1 year younger than Doris:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the ages for Herbert and Doris, such that Herbert's age is 1 year less than Doris's age. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    a1 == Herbert and a2 == Doris => a1_to_int == a2_to_int - 1, for all a1, a2 in ages.

-   The person who is 112 years old is either Herbert or the New Mexico native:
    This is a constraint that states that the person who is 112 years old is either Herbert or the New Mexico native, but not both. So:
    Xor([Age112 == Herbert, Age112 == NewMexico]).

### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Frances == 1, and $26 == 1, and Merlot == 1, then Frances paid $26 for the merlot.

-   The one who had the port paid 2 dollars more than Kurt:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the prices for the one who had the port and Kurt, such that the price for the port is 2 dollars more than Kurt's price. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Port and p2 == Kurt => p1_to_int == p2_to_int + 2, for all p1, p2 in prices.

-   Olga had the merlot:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:

    This is a constraint that states that one of Frances or Olga paid $25 and the other had the shiraz. So:
    Xor([Frances == Price25, Frances == Shiraz], [Olga == Price25, Olga == Shiraz]).

-   The one who had the port paid 2 dollars more than Kurt:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the prices for the one who had the port and Kurt, such that the price for the port is 2 dollars more than Kurt's price. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Port and p2 == Kurt => p1_to_int == p2_to_int + 2, for all p1, p2 in prices.

The hotel that costs $215 per night is either the hotel on St. Barts or Emerald View.
Grand Echo costs 20 dollars less per night than Emerald View.

Entities:
prices: $175, $195, $215, $235
resorts: El Pacifico, Emerald View, Grand Echo, Regal Park
islands: Anguilla, Barbados, Martinique, St. Barts
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if ElPacifico == 1, and $175 == 1, and Anguilla == 1, then El Pacifico costs $175 per night on Anguilla.

### Constraints:
-   Regal Park is on Barbados:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:

-   Grand Echo costs 40 dollars more per night than the resort on Barbados:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the prices for Grand Echo and the resort on Barbados, such that Grand Echo's price is 40 dollars more than the price for Barbados. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == GrandEcho and p2 == Barbados => p1_to_int == p2_to_int + 40, for all p1, p2 in prices.

-   Of El Pacifico and Regal Park, one is on Martinique and the other costs $175 per night:
    This is a constraint that states that El Pacifico and Regal Park are on different islands and have different prices. So:

    ElPacifico == Martinique or Price175 == ElPacifico.
    RegalPark == Martinique or Price175 == RegalPark.

-   The hotel that costs $215 per night is either the hotel on St. Barts or Emerald View:
    This is a constraint that states that the hotel that costs $215 per night is either on St. Barts or is Emerald View, but not both. So:
    Xor([Price215 == StBarts, Price215 == EmeraldView]).

-   Of El Pacifico and Regal Park, one is on Martinique and the other costs $175 per night:
    This is a constraint that states that El Pacifico and Regal Park are on different islands and have different prices. So:

Clues:
Of the parrot and the lorikeet, one was bought in April and the other is Roberta's.
Natalie's pet was bought sometime before Roberta's pet.
Laura's pet is the lovebird.
The bird bought in February is either the lorikeet or the lovebird.
Of the bird bought in February and the macaw, one is Natalie's and the other is Roberta's.

Entities:
months: January, February, March, April
names: Celia, Laura, Natalie, Roberta
birds: lorikeet, lovebird, macaw, parrot
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Celia == 1, and January == 1, and Lorikeet == 1, then Celia bought the lorikeet in January.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the owners: Celia, Laura, Natalie, Roberta (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Months of purchase: January, February, March, April (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Types of birds: Lorikeet, Lovebird, Macaw, Parrot (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   Of the parrot and the lorikeet, one was bought in April and the other is Roberta's:
    This is a constraint that states that one of the birds is a parrot and the other is a lorikeet, one was bought in April, and the lorikeet is Roberta's. So:
    (Parrot == April and Lorikeet == Roberta) or (Lorikeet == April and Parrot == Roberta).

-   Natalie's pet was bought sometime before Roberta's pet:
    This is a constraint that states that Natalie's bird was bought before Roberta's bird. So:
    Natalie < Roberta.

-   Laura's pet is the lovebird:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Laura == Lovebird.

-   The bird bought in February is either the lorikeet or the lovebird:
    This is a constraint that states that the bird bought in February is either the lorikeet or the lovebird, but not both. So:
    Xor([February == Lorikeet, February == Lovebird]).

-   Of the bird bought in February and the macaw, one is Natalie's and the other is Roberta's:
    This is a constraint that states that the bird bought in February is either the macaw or belongs to Natalie, and the other bird is Roberta's. So:
    (February == Macaw and Natalie == Roberta) or (February == Roberta and Macaw == Natalie).
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Celia == 1, and January == 1, and Lorikeet == 1, then Celia bought the lorikeet in January.

-   Types of birds: Lorikeet, Lovebird, Macaw, Parrot (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   Of the parrot and the lorikeet, one was bought in April and the other is Roberta's:
    This is a constraint that states that one of the birds is a parrot and the other is a lorikeet, one was bought in April, and the lorikeet is Roberta's. So:
    (Parrot == April and Lorikeet == Roberta) or (Lorikeet == April and Parrot == Roberta).

-   Natalie's pet was bought sometime before Roberta's pet:
    This is a constraint that states that Natalie's bird was bought before Roberta's bird. So:
    Natalie < Roberta.

-   Laura's pet is the lovebird:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Laura == Lovebird.

-   The bird bought in February is either the lorikeet or the lovebird:
    This is a constraint that states that the bird bought in February is either the lorikeet or the lovebird, but not both. So:
    Xor([February == Lorikeet, February == Lovebird]).

-   Of the bird bought in February and the macaw, one is Natalie's and the other is Roberta's:
    This is a constraint that states that the bird bought in February is either the macaw or belongs to Natalie, and the other bird is Roberta's. So:
    (February == Macaw and Natalie == Roberta) or (February == Roberta and Macaw == Natalie).

Clues:
The Luzagueil is a chardonnay.
The Annata Branco is either the 1992 wine or the syrah.
The Friambliss is a syrah.
Of the pinot gris and the 1984 bottle, one is the Luzagueil and the other is the Zifennwein.
The pinot gris was bottled 4 years after the merlot.

Entities:
vintages: 1984, 1988, 1992, 1996
wines: Annata Branco, Friambliss, Luzagueil, Zifennwein
types: chardonnay, merlot, pinot gris, syrah
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if AnnataBranco == 1, and 1992 == 1, and Syrah == 1, then Annata Branco is the 1992 wine and is a syrah.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the wines: AnnataBranco, Friambliss, Luzagueil, Zifennwein (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Vintages of the wines: Vintage1984, Vintage1988, Vintage1992, Vintage1996 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Types of the wines: Chardonnay, Merlot, PinotGris, Syrah (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
1. The Luzagueil is a chardonnay:
   This is a direct assignment constraint:
   Luzagueil == Chardonnay.

2. The Annata Branco is either the 1992 wine or the syrah:
   This is a constraint that states that the Annata Branco's vintage is either 1992 or its type is syrah, but not both. So:
   Xor([AnnataBranco == Vintage1992, AnnataBranco == Syrah]).

3. The Friambliss is a syrah:
   This is a direct assignment constraint:
   Friambliss == Syrah.

4. Of the pinot gris and the 1984 bottle, one is the Luzagueil and the other is the Zifennwein:
   This is a constraint that states that for the pinot gris and the 1984 vintage, one is associated with Luzagueil and the other with Zifennwein, but not both. So:
   Xor([
       (PinotGris == Luzagueil, Vintage1984 == Zifennwein),
       (PinotGris == Zifennwein, Vintage1984 == Luzagueil)
   ]).

5. The pinot gris was bottled 4 years after the merlot:
   For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the vintages for the pinot gris and the merlot, such that the pinot gris's vintage is 4 years after the merlot's vintage. So, the constraints will be of the form:
   v1 == PinotGris and v2 == Merlot => v1_to_int == v2_to_int + 4, for all v1, v2 in vintages.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if AnnataBranco == 1, and 1992 == 1, and Syrah == 1, then Annata Branco is the 1992 wine and is a syrah.

   Xor([AnnataBranco == Vintage1992, AnnataBranco == Syrah]).

3. The Friambliss is a syrah:
   This is a direct assignment constraint:
   Friambliss == Syrah.

4. Of the pinot gris and the 1984 bottle, one is the Luzagueil and the other is the Zifennwein:
   This is a constraint that states that for the pinot gris and the 1984 vintage, one is associated with Luzagueil and the other with Zifennwein, but not both. So:
   Xor([
       (PinotGris == Luzagueil, Vintage1984 == Zifennwein),
       (PinotGris == Zifennwein, Vintage1984 == Luzagueil)
   ]).

Clues:
The variety that requires 190 degree water costs 1 dollar less than the variety that requires 195 degree water.
The Pouchong costs 1 dollar less than the Red Robe.
The Pouchong needs 195 degree water.
The four teas are the Ali Shan, the variety that costs $6, the variety that requires 200 degree water and the tea that requires 190 degree water.

Entities:
teas: Ali Shan, Jin Xuan, Pouchong, Red Robe
prices: $4, $5, $6, $7
temperatures: 190 degree, 195 degree, 200 degree, 215 degree
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if AliShan == 1, and $6 == 1, and 200Degree == 1, then Ali Shan costs $6 and requires 200-degree water.

### Decision variables:
-   Types of teas: Ali Shan, Jin Xuan, Pouchong, Red Robe (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Prices of teas: Price4, Price5, Price6, Price7 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Water temperatures required: 190Degree, 195Degree, 200Degree, 215Degree (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The variety that requires 190-degree water costs 1 dollar less than the variety that requires 195-degree water:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of teas that require 190-degree and 195-degree water, such that the price of the 190-degree tea is 1 dollar less than the price of the 195-degree tea. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    t1 == 190Degree and t2 == 195Degree => t1_to_int == t2_to_int - 1, for all t1, t2 in teas.

-   The Pouchong costs 1 dollar less than the Red Robe:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of Pouchong and Red Robe, such that the price of Pouchong is 1 dollar less than the price of Red Robe. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    t1 == Pouchong and t2 == RedRobe => t1_to_int == t2_to_int - 1, for all t1, t2 in teas.

-   The Pouchong needs 195-degree water:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Pouchong == 195Degree.

-   The four teas are the Ali Shan, the variety that costs $6, the variety that requires 200-degree water, and the tea that requires 190-degree water:
    This is a constraint that states that all these entities are different, thus:
    AllDifferent([AliShan, Price6, 200Degree, 190Degree]).
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if AliShan == 1, and $6 == 1, and 200Degree == 1, then Ali Shan costs $6 and requires 200-degree water.

### Constraints:
-   The variety that requires 190-degree water costs 1 dollar less than the variety that requires 195-degree water:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of teas that require 190-degree and 195-degree water, such that the price of the 190-degree tea is 1 dollar less than the price of the 195-degree tea. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    t1 == 190Degree and t2 == 195Degree => t1_to_int == t2_to_int - 1, for all t1, t2 in teas.

-   The Pouchong costs 1 dollar less than the Red Robe:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of Pouchong and Red Robe, such that the price of Pouchong is 1 dollar less than the price of Red Robe. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    t1 == Pouchong and t2 == RedRobe => t1_to_int == t2_to_int - 1, for all t1, t2 in teas.

-   The Pouchong needs 195-degree water:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Pouchong == 195Degree.

-   The four teas are the Ali Shan, the variety that costs $6, the variety that requires 200-degree water, and the tea that requires 190-degree water:
    This is a constraint that states that all these entities are different, thus:

Clues:
The flier leaving in April will bring shamrock.
The passenger with the rabbit's foot will leave 1 month after Troy.

The flier with the horseshoe is either Peggy or the passenger leaving in January.

Entities:
fliers: Doug, Eloise, Peggy, Troy
months: January, February, March, April
lucky charms: coin, horseshoe, rabbit's foot, shamrock
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Doug == 1, and January == 1, and Coin == 1, then Doug is the passenger leaving in January with the coin.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the fliers: Doug, Eloise, Peggy, Troy (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Months of departure: January, February, March, April (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Types of lucky charms: Coin, Horseshoe, RabbitsFoot, Shamrock (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The flier leaving in April will bring shamrock:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    April == Shamrock.

-   The passenger with the rabbit's foot will leave 1 month after Troy:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months of departure for Troy and the passenger with the rabbit's foot, such that the rabbit's foot's month of departure is 1 more than Troy's month of departure. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == Troy and m2 == RabbitsFoot => m2_to_int == m1_to_int + 1, for all m1, m2 in months of departure.

-   The flier with the horseshoe will leave 1 month after Doug:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months of departure for Doug and the flier with the horseshoe, such that the horseshoe's month of departure is 1 more than Doug's month of departure. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == Doug and m2 == Horseshoe => m2_to_int == m1_to_int + 1, for all m1, m2 in months of departure.

-   The flier with the horseshoe is either Peggy or the passenger leaving in January:
    This is a constraint that states that the flier with the horseshoe is either Peggy or the passenger leaving in January, but not both. So:
    Xor([Horseshoe == Peggy, January == Horseshoe]).
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Doug == 1, and January == 1, and Coin == 1, then Doug is the passenger leaving in January with the coin.

-   The passenger with the rabbit's foot will leave 1 month after Troy:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months of departure for Troy and the passenger with the rabbit's foot, such that the rabbit's foot's month of departure is 1 more than Troy's month of departure. So, the constraints will be of the form:

Clues:
Ronda's sandwich and the sandwich with havarti cheese are different sandwiches.
Ronda's order costs $5.
Lula's order is either the 3 dollars sandwich or the order that costs 5 dollars.
The sandwich with cheddar cheese costs less than the order with havarti cheese.
Yolanda's sandwich costs 2 dollars less than the order with swiss cheese.

Entities:
customers: Lula, Ronda, Sue, Yolanda
prices: $2, $3, $4, $5
cheeses: cheddar, havarti, muenster, swiss
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Ronda == 1, and $5 == 1, and Cheddar == 1, then Ronda's sandwich costs $5 and has cheddar cheese.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the customers: Lula, Ronda, Sue, Yolanda (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Prices of the orders: Price2, Price3, Price4, Price5 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Types of cheeses: Cheddar, Havarti, Muenster, Swiss (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   Ronda's sandwich and the sandwich with havarti cheese are different sandwiches:
    This constraint ensures that Ronda's sandwich and the sandwich with havarti cheese are different. So, we need to add a constraint to ensure that the cheeses for Ronda and Havarti are different:
    cheese1 != cheese2, for all cheese1, cheese2 in cheeses.

-   Ronda's order costs $5:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Ronda == Price5.

-   Lula's order is either the $3 sandwich or the order that costs $5:
    This constraint states that Lula's order is either $3 or $5. So, we need to add a constraint to ensure that Lula's order is either $3 or $5:
    Lula == Price3 or Lula == Price5.

-   The sandwich with cheddar cheese costs less than the order with havarti cheese:
    For this, we need to add a constraint to ensure that the order with cheddar cheese costs less than the order with havarti cheese:
    cheddar_price < havarti_price.

-   Yolanda's sandwich costs $2 less than the order with swiss cheese:
    For this, we need to add a constraint to ensure that Yolanda's order costs $2 less than the order with swiss cheese:
    swiss_price - 2 == Yolanda_price.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Ronda == 1, and $5 == 1, and Cheddar == 1, then Ronda's sandwich costs $5 and has cheddar cheese.

    cheese1 != cheese2, for all cheese1, cheese2 in cheeses.

-   Ronda's order costs $5:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Ronda == Price5.

-   Lula's order is either the $3 sandwich or the order that costs $5:
    This constraint states that Lula's order is either $3 or $5. So, we need to add a constraint to ensure that Lula's order is either $3 or $5:
    Lula == Price3 or Lula == Price5.

-   The sandwich with cheddar cheese costs less than the order with havarti cheese:
    For this, we need to add a constraint to ensure that the order with cheddar cheese costs less than the order with havarti cheese:
    cheddar_price < havarti_price.

-   Yolanda's sandwich costs $2 less than the order with swiss cheese:
    For this, we need to add a constraint to ensure that Yolanda's order costs $2 less than the order with swiss cheese:
    swiss_price - 2 == Yolanda_price.

Clues:
The rocket developed by Vexatech will launch 1 month after the Exatris.
The rocket developed by SpaceZen will launch sometime after the Beritron.
The Worul is made by Techtrin.
The Exatris will launch in January.
The Cornick is either the rocket that will launch in April or the rocket developed by Rubicorp.

Entities:
rockets: Beritron, Cornick, Exatris, Worul
months: January, February, March, April
companies: Rubicorp, SpaceZen, Techtrin, Vexatech
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Beritron == 1, and January == 1, and Rubicorp == 1, then Beritron is the rocket that will launch in January and is developed by Rubicorp.

### Decision variables:

-   Months of launch: January, February, March, April (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Companies that developed the rockets: Rubicorp, SpaceZen, Techtrin, Vexatech (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The rocket developed by Vexatech will launch 1 month after the Exatris:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months of launch for the rocket developed by Vexatech and the Exatris, such that Vexatech's rocket's month of launch is 1 month after the Exatris's month of launch. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == Vexatech and m2 == Exatris => m1_to_int == m2_to_int + 1, for all m1, m2 in months of launch.

-   The rocket developed by SpaceZen will launch sometime after the Beritron:
    This is a constraint that states that the rocket developed by SpaceZen will launch after the Beritron, but does not specify the exact number of months. So, the constraint will be:
    m1 == SpaceZen and m2 == Beritron => m1_to_int > m2_to_int, for all m1, m2 in months of launch.

-   The Worul is made by Techtrin:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Worul == Techtrin.

-   The Exatris will launch in January:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Exatris == January.

-   The Cornick is either the rocket that will launch in April or the rocket developed by Rubicorp:
    This is a constraint that states that the Cornick is associated with either April or Rubicorp, but not both. So:
    Xor([Cornick == April, Cornick == Rubicorp]).
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Beritron == 1, and January == 1, and Rubicorp == 1, then Beritron is the rocket that will launch in January and is developed by Rubicorp.

### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Anna == 1, and Scholarship25000 == 1, and Biology == 1, then Anna received a $25000 scholarship for majoring in Biology.

### Constraints:
-   The student who will major in Physics was awarded $5000 less than the student who will major in Biology:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of scholarships to Physics and Biology students, such that the Physics student's scholarship is $5000 less than the Biology student's scholarship. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    s1 == Physics and s2 == Biology => s1_to_int == s2_to_int - 5000, for all s1, s2 in scholarships.

-   Wilma will major in Mathematics:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:

-   Delores was awarded $5000 more than Anna:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of scholarships to Delores and Anna, such that Delores's scholarship is $5000 more than Anna's scholarship. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    s1 == Delores and s2 == Anna => s1_to_int == s2_to_int + 5000, for all s1, s2 in scholarships.

-   Anna was awarded some amount less than the person who will major in Mathematics:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of scholarships to Anna and the Mathematics student, such that Anna's scholarship is less than the Mathematics student's scholarship. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    s1 == Anna and s2 == Mathematics => s1_to_int < s2_to_int, for all s1, s2 in scholarships.

-   Wilma is either the person who received the $35000 scholarship or the person who received the $25000 scholarship:
    This is a constraint that states that Wilma received either $35000 or $25000 scholarship, but not both. Thus:
    Xor([Wilma == Scholarship35000, Wilma == Scholarship25000]).

Clues:
The ambassador with the 9 day visit will leave sometime after Fitzgerald.
Quinn will leave 2 months after Bender.
The person leaving in January is either the ambassador with the 3 day visit or Fitzgerald.
Quinn will leave 1 month before the ambassador with the 7 day visit.

Entities:
diplomats: Bender, Fitzgerald, Owens, Quinn
months: January, February, March, April
durations: 2 day, 3 day, 7 day, 9 day
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Bender == 1, and January == 1, and Day2 == 1, then Bender is the ambassador leaving in January with a 2-day visit.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the diplomats: Bender, Fitzgerald, Owens, Quinn (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Months of departure: January, February, March, April (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Visit durations: Day2, Day3, Day7, Day9 (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The ambassador with the 9-day visit will leave sometime after Fitzgerald:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months of departure for the ambassador with the 9-day visit and Fitzgerald, such that Fitzgerald's month of departure is less than the 9-day ambassador's month of departure. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == Fitzgerald and m2 == Day9 => m1_to_int < m2_to_int, for all m1, m2 in months of departure.

-   Quinn will leave 2 months after Bender:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months of departure for Quinn and Bender, such that Quinn's month of departure is 2 more than Bender's month of departure. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == Quinn and m2 == Bender => m1_to_int == m2_to_int + 2, for all m1, m2 in months of departure.

-   The person leaving in January is either the ambassador with the 3-day visit or Fitzgerald:
    This is a constraint that states that the person leaving in January is either the ambassador with the 3-day visit or Fitzgerald, but not both. So:
    Xor([January == Day3, January == Fitzgerald]).

-   Quinn will leave 1 month before the ambassador with the 7-day visit:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months of departure for Quinn and the ambassador with the 7-day visit, such that Quinn's month of departure is 1 less than the 7-day ambassador's month of departure. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == Quinn and m2 == Day7 => m1_to_int == m2_to_int - 1, for all m1, m2 in months of departure.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Bender == 1, and January == 1, and Day2 == 1, then Bender is the ambassador leaving in January with a 2-day visit.

    m1 == Fitzgerald and m2 == Day9 => m1_to_int < m2_to_int, for all m1, m2 in months of departure.

-   Quinn will leave 2 months after Bender:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months of departure for Quinn and Bender, such that Quinn's month of departure is 2 more than Bender's month of departure. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == Quinn and m2 == Bender => m1_to_int == m2_to_int + 2, for all m1, m2 in months of departure.

-   The person leaving in January is either the ambassador with the 3-day visit or Fitzgerald:
    This is a constraint that states that the person leaving in January is either the ambassador with the 3-day visit or Fitzgerald, but not both. So:
    Xor([January == Day3, January == Fitzgerald]).

-   Quinn will leave 1 month before the ambassador with the 7-day visit:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months of departure for Quinn and the ambassador with the 7-day visit, such that Quinn's month of departure is 1 less than the 7-day ambassador's month of departure. So, the constraints will be of the form:

Clues:
The person who came in at 8:00am asked for wheat bread.
Tricia came in a half-hour after Ora.
Of Felicia and the customer who ordered flatbread, one came in at 7:30am and the other came in at 7:00am.
Of the customer who ordered wheat bread; and the person who ordered pumpernickel, one came in at 8:30am and the other was Tricia.

Entities:
breads: flatbread, pumpernickel, rye bread, wheat bread
times: 7:00am, 7:30am, 8:00am, 8:30am
customers: Felicia, Isabel, Ora, Tricia
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Felicia == 1, and 7:00am == 1, and flatbread == 1, then Felicia ordered flatbread at 7:00am.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the customers: Felicia, Isabel, Ora, Tricia (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Times of arrival: 7:00am, 7:30am, 8:00am, 8:30am (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The person who came in at 8:00am asked for wheat bread:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:

-   Tricia came in a half-hour after Ora:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the times for Tricia and Ora, such that Tricia's arrival time is half an hour after Ora's arrival time. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    t1 == Tricia and t2 == Ora => t1_to_int == t2_to_int + 1, for all t1, t2 in times.

-   Of Felicia and the customer who ordered flatbread, one came in at 7:30am and the other came in at 7:00am:
    This is a constraint that states that Felicia's arrival time is either 7:30am and the customer who ordered flatbread's arrival time is 7:00am, or vice versa. So:
    Xor([Felicia == 7:30am and flatbread == 7:00am, Felicia == 7:00am and flatbread == 7:30am]).

-   Of the customer who ordered wheat bread and the person who ordered pumpernickel, one came in at 8:30am and the other was Tricia:
    This is a constraint that states that the customer who ordered wheat bread's arrival time is either 8:30am and the person who ordered pumpernickel's arrival time is Tricia, or vice versa. So:

Clues:
The 75 million year old fossil costs 500 dollars less than the pilodontus.
The senosaurus is 85 million years old.
The 75 million year old fossil costs 500 dollars less than the 78 million year old fossil.
The 75 million year old fossil costs less than the archadon.
The 69 million year old fossil costs 250 dollars more than the 78 million year old fossil.

Entities:
dinosaurs: archadon, mirasaurus, pilodontus, senosaurus
price: $500, $750, $1000, $1250
ages: 69 million, 75 million, 78 million, 85 million
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Archadon == 1, and Price500 == 1, and Age69 == 1, then Archadon is priced at $500 and is 69 million years old.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the dinosaurs: Archadon, Mirasaurus, Pilodontus, Senosaurus (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Prices of the fossils: Price500, Price750, Price1000, Price1250 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Ages of the fossils: Age69, Age75, Age78, Age85 (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The 75 million year old fossil costs 500 dollars less than the pilodontus:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the ages for the 75 million year old fossil and the pilodontus, such that the price of the 75 million year old fossil is $500 less than the pilodontus. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    a1 == Age75 and a2 == Pilodontus => p1 == p2 + 1, for all a1, a2 in ages, p1 in prices, p2 in prices.

-   The senosaurus is 85 million years old:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Senosaurus == Age85.

-   The 75 million year old fossil costs 500 dollars less than the 78 million year old fossil:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the ages for the 75 million year old fossil and the 78 million year old fossil, such that the price of the 75 million year old fossil is $500 less than the 78 million year old fossil. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    a1 == Age75 and a2 == Age78 => p1 == p2 + 1, for all a1, a2 in ages, p1 in prices, p2 in prices.

-   The 75 million year old fossil costs less than the archadon:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the ages for the 75 million year old fossil and the archadon, such that the price of the 75 million year old fossil is less than the archadon. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    a1 == Age75 and a2 == Archadon => p1 < p2, for all a1, a2 in ages, p1 in prices, p2 in prices.

-   The 69 million year old fossil costs 250 dollars more than the 78 million year old fossil:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the ages for the 69 million year old fossil and the 78 million year old fossil, such that the price of the 69 million year old fossil is $250 more than the 78 million year old fossil. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    a1 == Age69 and a2 == Age78 => p1 == p2 + 2, for all a1, a2 in ages, p1 in prices, p2 in prices.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Archadon == 1, and Price500 == 1, and Age69 == 1, then Archadon is priced at $500 and is 69 million years old.

Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Glenn == 1, and 8am == 1, and dining room == 1, then Glenn's task is in the dining room starting at 8:00 am.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the children: Glenn, Henrietta, Olivia, Willie (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Times of the tasks: 8:00am, 9:00am, 10:00am, 11:00am (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Rooms of the tasks: dining room, laundry room, living room, mud room (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   Henrietta's task starts 2 hours after Glenn's job:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the times for Henrietta and Glenn, such that Henrietta's task time is 2 hours after Glenn's task time. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    t1 == Henrietta and t2 == Glenn => t1_to_int == t2_to_int + 2, for all t1, t2 in times.

-   Glenn's task is the dining room:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Glenn == dining room.

-   Glenn's chore starts 1 hour after the mud room assignment:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the times for Glenn and the mud room assignment, such that Glenn's task time is 1 hour after the mud room assignment time. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    t1 == Glenn and t2 == mud room => t1_to_int == t2_to_int + 1, for all t1, t2 in times.

-   Henrietta's task is the living room:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Henrietta == living room.

-   The mud room assignment starts sometime before Willie's assignment:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the times for the mud room assignment and Willie's assignment, such that the mud room assignment time is before Willie's assignment time. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    t1 == mud room and t2 == Willie => t1_to_int < t2_to_int, for all t1, t2 in times.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Glenn == 1, and 8am == 1, and dining room == 1, then Glenn's task is in the dining room starting at 8:00 am.

The customer going out on July 14 will go out with Hilda.
The customer going out with Vicki is either Mr. Gallegos or the customer going out on July 14.
The customer going out with Nadine will dive 1 day before Mr. Ayers.

Entities:
customers: Mr. Ayers, Mr. Drake, Mr. Erickson, Mr. Gallegos
dates: July 13, July 14, July 15, July 16

### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if MrAyers == 1, and July14 == 1, and Hilda == 1, then Mr. Ayers will dive on July 14 with Hilda.

### Decision variables:

    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the dates for the diver going out with Hilda and Mr. Drake, such that Mr. Drake's dive date is 1 more than the diver going out with Hilda's dive date. So, the constraints will be of the form:

    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the dates for the customer going out with Nadine and Mr. Ayers, such that the customer going out with Nadine's dive date is 1 less than Mr. Ayers's dive date. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    d1 == Nadine and d2 == MrAyers => d1_to_int == d2_to_int - 1, for all d1, d2 in dates.

The study on the Liberty starts 2 months after Eunice's project.

Entities:
students: Eunice, Felix, Natasha, Stacy
months: March, April, May, June
ships: Escape, Liberty, Odyssey, Osprey
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Eunice == 1, and March == 1, and Odyssey == 1, then Eunice's project is on the Odyssey and starts in March.

### Decision variables:

-   Start months of the projects: March, April, May, June (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Names of the ships: Escape, Liberty, Odyssey, Osprey (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   Natasha's study starts 2 months after the project on the Odyssey:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the start months for Natasha's study and the project on the Odyssey, such that Natasha's study's start month is 2 months after the Odyssey's project start month. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == Natasha and m2 == Odyssey => m1_to_int == m2_to_int + 2, for all m1, m2 in months.

-   Of the assignment on the Liberty and the assignment on the Escape, one is Felix's assignment and the other starts in March:
    This is a constraint that states that for the assignments on the Liberty and the Escape, one is Felix's and the other starts in March. So:
    Xor([
        (Liberty == Felix, Escape == March),
        (Liberty == March, Escape == Felix)
    ]).

-   The study on the Liberty starts 2 months after Eunice's project:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the start months for the study on the Liberty and Eunice's project, such that the study on the Liberty's start month is 2 months after Eunice's project start month. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == Liberty and m2 == Eunice => m1_to_int == m2_to_int + 2, for all m1, m2 in months.
### Plan:

-   The study on the Liberty starts 2 months after Eunice's project:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the start months for the study on the Liberty and Eunice's project, such that the study on the Liberty's start month is 2 months after Eunice's project start month. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == Liberty and m2 == Eunice => m1_to_int == m2_to_int + 2, for all m1, m2 in months.
```python
from cpmpy import *

# Decision variables
# (variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet of student, month, and ship)
# e.g. if eunice == 1 and march == 1 and escape == 1, then Eunice's project on the Escape starts in March

Clues:
The project headed by Dr. Golden will go online sometime before the Zynga Complex.
The project headed by Dr. Weber will go online 1 year before the Bale-Hahn SSC.
The Egert Facility will go online 1 year after the ISON-X42.
The project headed by Dr. Owens will go online 1 year after the ISON-X42.

Entities:
years: 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019
names: Bale-Hahn SSC, Egert Facility, ISON-X42, Zynga Complex
scientists: Dr. Farley, Dr. Golden, Dr. Owens, Dr. Weber
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if BaleHahnSSC == 1, and 2016 == 1, and DrFarley == 1, then the Bale-Hahn SSC project, headed by Dr. Farley, went online in 2016.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the projects: BaleHahnSSC, EgertFacility, ISONX42, ZyngaComplex (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Years the projects go online: Year2016, Year2017, Year2018, Year2019 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Names of the scientists: DrFarley, DrGolden, DrOwens, DrWeber (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The project headed by Dr. Golden will go online sometime before the Zynga Complex:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the years for Dr. Golden's project and the Zynga Complex, such that Dr. Golden's project's year is less than the Zynga Complex's year. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    y1 == DrGolden and y2 == ZyngaComplex => y1_to_int < y2_to_int, for all y1, y2 in years.

-   The project headed by Dr. Weber will go online 1 year before the Bale-Hahn SSC:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the years for Dr. Weber's project and the Bale-Hahn SSC, such that Dr. Weber's project's year is 1 less than the Bale-Hahn SSC's year. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    y1 == DrWeber and y2 == BaleHahnSSC => y1_to_int == y2_to_int - 1, for all y1, y2 in years.

-   The Egert Facility will go online 1 year after the ISON-X42:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the years for the Egert Facility and the ISON-X42, such that the Egert Facility's year is 1 more than the ISON-X42's year. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    y1 == EgertFacility and y2 == ISONX42 => y1_to_int == y2_to_int + 1, for all y1, y2 in years.

-   The project headed by Dr. Owens will go online 1 year after the ISON-X42:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the years for Dr. Owens's project and the ISON-X42, such that Dr. Owens's project's year is 1 more than the ISON-X42's year. So, the constraints will be of the form:

   - This can be represented as: AllDifferent(CarSpeed) and AllDifferent(CarDistance)

### Objective:
- The objective is to find the assignment of speeds and distances for each car that satisfies all the constraints.
```python
from cpmpy import *

# Decision variables
cars = ["Awick", "Leden", "Poltris", "Versem"]
speeds = [62, 69, 75, 81]
distances = [525, 550, 575, 600]

car_speed = intvar(62, 81, shape=4, name=cars)
car_distance = intvar(525, 600, shape=4, name=cars)

# Constraints
m = Model()

# Clue 1: The Leden drove 25 miles farther than the automobile with a high speed of 75 MPH
m += car_distance["Leden"] == car_distance[75] + 25

# Clue 2: The Poltris drove 25 miles farther than the automobile with a high speed of 69 MPH
m += car_distance["Poltris"] == car_distance[69] + 25

# Clue 3: The Awick drove somewhat less than the automobile with a high speed of 81 MPH
m += car_distance["Awick"] < car_distance[81]

# Clue 4: The car with a high speed of 69 MPH drove somewhat farther than the automobile with a high speed of 81 MPH
m += car_distance[69] > car_distance[81]

# All cars have different speeds and distances
m += AllDifferent(car_speed)
m += AllDifferent(car_distance)

Clues:
The worker who works in the green section served more riders than Brett.
Peter served 25 fewer riders than Willis.
Brett served more riders than Peter.
The person who works in the yellow section served 25 more riders than the worker who works in the orange section.
Peter is either the person who served 125 riders or the person who works in the blue section.

Entities:
employees: Brett, Peter, Victor, Willis
rides: 50 riders, 75 riders, 100 riders, 125 riders
section: blue, green, orange, yellow
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Brett == 1, and 50riders == 1, and Green == 1, then Brett is the worker who served 50 riders and works in the green section.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the employees: Brett, Peter, Victor, Willis (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Number of riders served: Riders50, Riders75, Riders100, Riders125 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Colors of the sections: Blue, Green, Orange, Yellow (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The worker who works in the green section served more riders than Brett:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the number of riders served by the worker in the green section and Brett, such that the green section's worker served more riders than Brett. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    r1 == Green and r2 == Brett => r1_to_int > r2_to_int, for all r1, r2 in riders.

-   Peter served 25 fewer riders than Willis:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the number of riders served by Peter and Willis, such that Peter served 25 fewer riders than Willis. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    r1 == Peter and r2 == Willis => r1_to_int == r2_to_int - 25, for all r1, r2 in riders.

-   Brett served more riders than Peter:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the number of riders served by Brett and Peter, such that Brett served more riders than Peter. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    r1 == Brett and r2 == Peter => r1_to_int > r2_to_int, for all r1, r2 in riders.

-   The person who works in the yellow section served 25 more riders than the worker who works in the orange section:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the number of riders served by the worker in the yellow section and the worker in the orange section, such that the yellow section's worker served 25 more riders than the orange section's worker. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    r1 == Yellow and r2 == Orange => r1_to_int == r2_to_int + 25, for all r1, r2 in riders.

-   Peter is either the person who served 125 riders or the person who works in the blue section:
    This is a constraint that states that Peter's number of riders served is either 125 or Peter works in the blue section, but not both. So:
    Xor([Peter == Riders125, Peter == Blue]).
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Brett == 1, and 50riders == 1, and Green == 1, then Brett is the worker who served 50 riders and works in the green section.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the employees: Brett, Peter, Victor, Willis (all different, 1 to 4)

    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the number of riders served by the worker in the green section and Brett, such that the green section's worker served more riders than Brett. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    r1 == Green and r2 == Brett => r1_to_int > r2_to_int, for all r1, r2 in riders.

-   Peter served 25 fewer riders than Willis:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the number of riders served by Peter and Willis, such that Peter served 25 fewer riders than Willis. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    r1 == Peter and r2 == Willis => r1_to_int == r2_to_int - 25, for all r1, r2 in riders.

-   Brett served more riders than Peter:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the number of riders served by Brett and Peter, such that Brett served more riders than Peter. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    r1 == Brett and r2 == Peter => r1_to_int > r2_to_int, for all r1, r2 in riders.

-   The person who works in the yellow section served 25 more riders than the worker who works in the orange section:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the number of riders served by the worker in the yellow section and the worker in the orange section, such that the yellow section's worker served 25 more riders than the orange section's worker. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    r1 == Yellow and r2 == Orange => r1_to_int == r2_to_int + 25, for all r1, r2 in riders.

-   Peter is either the person who served 125 riders or the person who works in the blue section:
    This is a constraint that states that Peter's number of riders served is either 125 or Peter works in the blue section, but not both. So:

Clues:
The team from Venezuela finished with 4 gold medals.
The squad that won 2 gold medals ended with 6 silver medals.
The four teams were the squad from Zimbabwe, the team that won 3 gold medals, the squad that won 6 silver medals and the squad that won 8 silver medals.
The team from Dominica ended the games with 1 fewer gold medal than the squad that won 5 silver medals.

Entities:
countries: Dominica, Jordan, Venezuela, Zimbabwe
gold medals: 1, 2, 3, 4
silver medals: 2, 5, 6, 8
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Dominica == 1, and Gold1 == 1, and Silver2 == 1, then Dominica won 1 gold medal and 2 silver medals.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the countries: Dominica, Jordan, Venezuela, Zimbabwe (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Number of gold medals won: Gold1, Gold2, Gold3, Gold4 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Number of silver medals won: Silver2, Silver5, Silver6, Silver8 (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The team from Venezuela finished with 4 gold medals:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Venezuela == Gold4.

-   The squad that won 2 gold medals ended with 6 silver medals:
    This is a direct assignment constraint linking gold medals to silver medals:
    Gold2 == 2, Silver6 == 2.

-   The four teams were the squad from Zimbabwe, the team that won 3 gold medals, the squad that won 6 silver medals, and the squad that won 8 silver medals:
    This is a constraint that states that all these entities are different, thus:
    AllDifferent([Zimbabwe, Gold3, Silver6, Silver8]).

-   The team from Dominica ended the games with 1 fewer gold medal than the squad that won 5 silver medals:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the number of gold medals for Dominica and the squad that won 5 silver medals, such that Dominica's gold medals are 1 less than the squad's gold medals that won 5 silver medals. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    g1 == Dominica and g2 == Silver5 => g1 == g2 - 1, for all g1, g2 in gold medals.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Dominica == 1, and Gold1 == 1, and Silver2 == 1, then Dominica won 1 gold medal and 2 silver medals.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the countries: Dominica, Jordan, Venezuela, Zimbabwe (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Number of gold medals won: Gold1, Gold2, Gold3, Gold4 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Number of silver medals won: Silver2, Silver5, Silver6, Silver8 (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The team from Venezuela finished with 4 gold medals:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Venezuela == Gold4.

-   The squad that won 2 gold medals ended with 6 silver medals:
    This is a direct assignment constraint linking gold medals to silver medals:
    Gold2 == 2, Silver6 == 2.

-   The four teams were the squad from Zimbabwe, the team that won 3 gold medals, the squad that won 6 silver medals, and the squad that won 8 silver medals:
    This is a constraint that states that all these entities are different, thus:
    AllDifferent([Zimbabwe, Gold3, Silver6, Silver8]).

-   The team from Dominica ended the games with 1 fewer gold medal than the squad that won 5 silver medals:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the number of gold medals for Dominica and the squad that won 5 silver medals, such that Dominica's gold medals are 1 less than the squad's gold medals that won 5 silver medals. So, the constraints will be of the form:

Clues:
Hattie and the student who will major in Theology are different students.
The student who will major in English is either Tracy or the student who received the $25,000 scholarship.
Hattie was awarded $10,000 more than the person who will major in Physics.
The student who received the $40,000 scholarship will major in Theology.
Ora was awarded some amount less than the student who will major in Archaeology.

Entities:
names: Erma, Hattie, Ora, Tracy
scholarships: $25,000, $30,000, $35,000, $40,000
majors: Archaeology, English, Physics, Theology
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Erma == 1, and Scholarship25000 == 1, and Archaeology == 1, then Erma received the $25,000 scholarship to major in Archaeology.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the students: Erma, Hattie, Ora, Tracy (all different, 1 to 4)

-   Majors of the students: Archaeology, English, Physics, Theology (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   Hattie and the student who will major in Theology are different students:
    This is a constraint that states that Hattie and the student majoring in Theology are different, thus:
    AllDifferent([Hattie, Theology]).

-   The student who will major in English is either Tracy or the student who received the $25,000 scholarship:
    This is a constraint that states that the student majoring in English is either Tracy or the student with the $25,000 scholarship, but not both. Thus:
    Xor([English == Tracy, English == Scholarship25000]).

-   Hattie was awarded $10,000 more than the person majoring in Physics:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of scholarships to Hattie and the student majoring in Physics, such that Hattie's scholarship amount is $10,000 more than the student majoring in Physics. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    s1 == Hattie and s2 == Physics => s1_to_int == s2_to_int + 10000, for all s1, s2 in scholarships.

-   The student who received the $40,000 scholarship will major in Theology:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Scholarship40000 == Theology.

-   Ora was awarded some amount less than the student majoring in Archaeology:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of scholarships to Ora and the student majoring in Archaeology, such that Ora's scholarship amount is less than the student majoring in Archaeology. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    s1 == Ora and s2 == Archaeology => s1_to_int < s2_to_int, for all s1, s2 in scholarships.

    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the start years for Hatcha and the wing back, such that Hatcha's start year is 6 years after the wing back's start year. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    y1 == Hatcha and y2 == WingBack => y1_to_int == y2_to_int + 6, for all y1, y2 in years.

-   Kawa began playing in 1982:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Kawa == Year1982.

-   Banben was the center back:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Banben == CenterBack.

-   The person who started in 1985 was either Kawa or the center forward:
    This is a constraint that states that the player who started in 1985's position is either Kawa or the center forward, but not both. So:
    Xor([Year1985 == Kawa, Year1985 == CenterForward]).
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Kawa == 1, and 1982 == 1, and CenterForward == 1, then Kawa began playing in 1982 as a center forward.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the players: Banben, Hatcha, Kawa, Rothvum (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Start years of the players: Year1976, Year1979, Year1982, Year1985 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Positions of the players: CenterBack, CenterForward, Goalie, WingBack (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   Hatcha started 6 years after the wing back:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the start years for Hatcha and the wing back, such that Hatcha's start year is 6 years after the wing back's start year. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    y1 == Hatcha and y2 == WingBack => y1_to_int == y2_to_int + 6, for all y1, y2 in years.

Clues:
The puzzle with the postage stamp theme has somewhat fewer than the puzzle made by Astury.
The jigsaw puzzle with the outer space theme has 250 more pieces than the puzzle made by Garroda.
The jigsaw puzzle made by Garroda has somewhat fewer than the puzzle made by Vesem.
The jigsaw puzzle with the postage stamp theme has somewhat more than the puzzle with the city skyline theme.
The jigsaw puzzle made by Vesem has 500 pieces.

Entities:
companies: Astury, Denlend, Garroda, Vesem
pieces: 250, 500, 750, 1000
themes: autumn leaves, city skyline, outer space, postage stamp
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same quartet. For example, if Astury == 1, and 1000 == 1, and PostageStamp == 1, then the puzzle made by Astury has 1000 pieces and the postage stamp theme.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the companies: Astury, Denlend, Garroda, Vesem (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Number of pieces in the puzzles: Pieces250, Pieces500, Pieces750, Pieces1000 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Themes of the puzzles: AutumnLeaves, CitySkyline, OuterSpace, PostageStamp (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The puzzle with the postage stamp theme has somewhat fewer pieces than the puzzle made by Astury:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the number of pieces for the postage stamp theme and Astury, such that the postage stamp theme's puzzle has fewer pieces than Astury's puzzle. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == PostageStamp and p2 == Astury => p1_to_int < p2_to_int, for all p1, p2 in pieces.

-   The jigsaw puzzle with the outer space theme has 250 more pieces than the puzzle made by Garroda:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the number of pieces for the outer space theme and Garroda, such that the outer space theme's puzzle has 250 more pieces than Garroda's puzzle. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == OuterSpace and p2 == Garroda => p1_to_int == p2_to_int + 250, for all p1, p2 in pieces.

-   The jigsaw puzzle made by Garroda has somewhat fewer pieces than the puzzle made by Vesem:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the number of pieces for Garroda and Vesem, such that Garroda's puzzle has fewer pieces than Vesem's puzzle. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Garroda and p2 == Vesem => p1_to_int < p2_to_int, for all p1, p2 in pieces.

-   The jigsaw puzzle with the postage stamp theme has somewhat more pieces than the puzzle with the city skyline theme:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the number of pieces for the postage stamp theme and the city skyline theme, such that the postage stamp theme's puzzle has more pieces than the city skyline theme's puzzle. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == PostageStamp and p2 == CitySkyline => p1_to_int > p2_to_int, for all p1, p2 in pieces.

-   The jigsaw puzzle made by Vesem has 500 pieces:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Vesem == Pieces500.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same quartet. For example, if Astury == 1, and 1000 == 1, and PostageStamp == 1, then the puzzle made by Astury has 1000 pieces and the postage stamp theme.

-   The jigsaw puzzle with the outer space theme has 250 more pieces than the puzzle made by Garroda:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the number of pieces for the outer space theme and Garroda, such that the outer space theme's puzzle has 250 more pieces than Garroda's puzzle. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == OuterSpace and p2 == Garroda => p1_to_int == p2_to_int + 250, for all p1, p2 in pieces.

-   The jigsaw puzzle made by Garroda has somewhat fewer pieces than the puzzle made by Vesem:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the number of pieces for Garroda and Vesem, such that Garroda's puzzle has fewer pieces than Vesem's puzzle. So, the constraints will be of the form:

Clues:
The photo published by Nature Monthly was taken 2 months after the photo published by Earth Aware.
The shot of the white rhino was either the photo published by Earth Aware or the photo published by Animal Science.
The photo of the polar bear was taken sometime before the shot of the white rhino.
The photo taken in April was published by Animal Science.
The photo of the giant tortoise was taken in June.

Entities:
animals: giant tortoise, orangutan, polar bear, white rhino
months: March, April, May, June
magazines: Animal Science, Earth Aware, Nature Monthly, Wildzone
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if GiantTortoise == 1, and June == 1, and AnimalScience == 1, then the photo of the giant tortoise was taken in June and published by Animal Science.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the animals: GiantTortoise, Orangutan, PolarBear, WhiteRhino (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Months when the photos were taken: March, April, May, June (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Names of the magazines: AnimalScience, EarthAware, NatureMonthly, Wildzone (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The photo published by Nature Monthly was taken 2 months after the photo published by Earth Aware:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months for Nature Monthly and Earth Aware, such that the month of Nature Monthly's photo is 2 more than the month of Earth Aware's photo. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == NatureMonthly and m2 == EarthAware => m1_to_int == m2_to_int + 2, for all m1, m2 in months.

-   The shot of the white rhino was either the photo published by Earth Aware or the photo published by Animal Science:
    This is a constraint that states that the shot of the white rhino's photo is either from Earth Aware or from Animal Science, but not both. So:
    Xor([WhiteRhino == EarthAware, WhiteRhino == AnimalScience]).

-   The photo of the polar bear was taken sometime before the shot of the white rhino:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months for the polar bear and the white rhino, such that the month of the polar bear's photo is less than the month of the white rhino's photo. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == PolarBear and m2 == WhiteRhino => m1_to_int < m2_to_int, for all m1, m2 in months.

-   The photo taken in April was published by Animal Science:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    April == AnimalScience.

-   The photo of the giant tortoise was taken in June:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    GiantTortoise == June.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet.

-   Oginao is 5 ft shorter than Irskela:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the heights for Oginao and Irskela, such that Oginao's height is 5 ft shorter than Irskela's height. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    h1 == Oginao and h2 == Irskela => h1_to_int == h2_to_int - 5, for all h1, h2 in heights.

-   The fall in Brazil is either Cerbel or Inawatai:
    This is a constraint that states that the fall in Brazil is either Cerbel or Inawatai. So:

    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the heights for Cerbel and the fall in Canada, such that Cerbel's height is 10 ft shorter than the fall in Canada's height. So, the constraints will be of the form:

### Constraints:
-   Oginao is either the 105 ft tall fall or the 115 ft tall waterfall:
    This is a constraint that states that Oginao's height is either 105 ft or 115 ft. So:

Clues:
The 90 million year old fossil costs 250 dollars more than the pilodontus.
The gigasaurus costs 500 dollars more than the 78 million year old fossil.
The gigasaurus costs 250 dollars less than the 75 million year old fossil.
The mirasaurus is 90 million years old.

Entities:
dinosaurs: gigasaurus, mirasaurus, pilodontus, rotosaurus
prices: $500, $750, $1000, $1250
ages: 72 million, 75 million, 78 million, 90 million
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if gigasaurus == 1, and $500 == 1, and 72 million == 1, then gigasaurus costs $500 and is 72 million years old.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the dinosaurs: gigasaurus, mirasaurus, pilodontus, rotosaurus (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Prices of the dinosaurs: $500, $750, $1000, $1250 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Ages of the dinosaurs: 72 million, 75 million, 78 million, 90 million (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The 90 million year old fossil costs 250 dollars more than the pilodontus:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the prices for the 90 million year old fossil and the pilodontus, such that the price of the 90 million year old fossil is 250 dollars more than the pilodontus. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == 90 million and p2 == pilodontus => p1_to_int == p2_to_int + 250, for all p1, p2 in prices.

-   The gigasaurus costs 500 dollars more than the 78 million year old fossil:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the prices for the gigasaurus and the 78 million year old fossil, such that the price of the gigasaurus is 500 dollars more than the 78 million year old fossil. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == gigasaurus and p2 == 78 million => p1_to_int == p2_to_int + 500, for all p1, p2 in prices.

-   The gigasaurus costs 250 dollars less than the 75 million year old fossil:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the prices for the gigasaurus and the 75 million year old fossil, such that the price of the gigasaurus is 250 dollars less than the 75 million year old fossil. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == gigasaurus and p2 == 75 million => p1_to_int == p2_to_int - 250, for all p1, p2 in prices.

-   The mirasaurus is 90 million years old:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    mirasaurus == 90 million.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if gigasaurus == 1, and $500 == 1, and 72 million == 1, then gigasaurus costs $500 and is 72 million years old.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the dinosaurs: gigasaurus, mirasaurus, pilodontus, rotosaurus (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Prices of the dinosaurs: $500, $750, $1000, $1250 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Ages of the dinosaurs: 72 million, 75 million, 78 million, 90 million (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The 90 million year old fossil costs 250 dollars more than the pilodontus:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the prices for the 90 million year old fossil and the pilodontus, such that the price of the 90 million year old fossil is 250 dollars more than the pilodontus. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == 90 million and p2 == pilodontus => p1_to_int == p2_to_int + 250, for all p1, p2 in prices.

-   The gigasaurus costs 500 dollars more than the 78 million year old fossil:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the prices for the gigasaurus and the 78 million year old fossil, such that the price of the gigasaurus is 500 dollars more than the 78 million year old fossil. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == gigasaurus and p2 == 78 million => p1_to_int == p2_to_int + 500, for all p1, p2 in prices.

-   The gigasaurus costs 250 dollars less than the 75 million year old fossil:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the prices for the gigasaurus and the 75 million year old fossil, such that the price of the gigasaurus is 250 dollars less than the 75 million year old fossil. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == gigasaurus and p2 == 75 million => p1_to_int == p2_to_int - 250, for all p1, p2 in prices.

-   The mirasaurus is 90 million years old:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    mirasaurus == 90 million.

Clues:
The four conductors are Roderick, the conductor working on June 10, the person departing from Leland and the person departing from Indio.
The person working on June 13 will depart from Hardwick.
The conductor working on June 12 is either the conductor departing from Indio or Roderick.
Vernon is either the person working on June 11 or the conductor working on June 13.
Francis will leave sometime before the conductor departing from Leland.

Entities:
names: Francis, Luke, Roderick, Vernon
days: June 10, June 11, June 12, June 13
departures: Hardwick, Indio, Kent, Leland
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Francis == 1, and June10 == 1, and Hardwick == 1, then Francis will leave from Hardwick on June 10.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the conductors: Francis, Luke, Roderick, Vernon (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Days of work: June10, June11, June12, June13 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Departure locations: Hardwick, Indio, Kent, Leland (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The four conductors are Roderick, the conductor working on June 10, the person departing from Leland, and the person departing from Indio:
    This is a constraint that states the four conductors are Roderick, the conductor working on June 10, the person departing from Leland, and the person departing from Indio. So:
    AllDifferent([Roderick, June10, Leland, Indio]).

-   The person working on June 13 will depart from Hardwick:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    June13 == Hardwick.

-   The conductor working on June 12 is either the conductor departing from Indio or Roderick:
    This is a constraint that states the conductor working on June 12 is either the conductor departing from Indio or Roderick, but not both. So:
    Xor([June12 == Indio, June12 == Roderick]).

-   Vernon is either the person working on June 11 or the conductor working on June 13:
    This is a constraint that states Vernon is either the person working on June 11 or the conductor working on June 13, but not both. So:
    Xor([Vernon == June11, Vernon == June13]).

-   Francis will leave sometime before the conductor departing from Leland:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the departures for Francis and the conductor departing from Leland, such that Francis's departure is before the conductor departing from Leland. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    d1 == Francis and d2 == Leland => d1_to_int < d2_to_int, for all d1, d2 in departures.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Francis == 1, and June10 == 1, and Hardwick == 1, then Francis will leave from Hardwick on June 10.

    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    June13 == Hardwick.

-   The conductor working on June 12 is either the conductor departing from Indio or Roderick:
    This is a constraint that states the conductor working on June 12 is either the conductor departing from Indio or Roderick, but not both. So:
    Xor([June12 == Indio, June12 == Roderick]).

-   Vernon is either the person working on June 11 or the conductor working on June 13:
    This is a constraint that states Vernon is either the person working on June 11 or the conductor working on June 13, but not both. So:

Kathy Koch's reservation is either the 5 day reservation or the Fiat rental.
The 3 day rental, Irene Ingram's reservation and Kathy Koch's reservation are all different rentals.
Ann Alexander's rental is for 4 days.

Entities:
customers: Ann Alexander, Edna Erickson, Irene Ingram, Kathy Koch
contract length: 2 days, 3 days, 4 days, 5 days
cars: Fiat, Kia, Nissan, Toyota
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if AnnAlexander == 1, and FourDays == 1, and Fiat == 1, then Ann Alexander's rental is for 4 days for the Fiat.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the customers: AnnAlexander, EdnaErickson, IreneIngram, KathyKoch (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Length of the rental contracts: TwoDays, ThreeDays, FourDays, FiveDays (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Car models: Fiat, Kia, Nissan, Toyota (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The Kia rental is for a period 1 day shorter than the Toyota rental:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the rental lengths for Kia and Toyota, such that Kia's rental length is 1 less than Toyota's rental length. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    r1 == Kia and r2 == Toyota => r1_to_int == r2_to_int - 1, for all r1, r2 in contract lengths.

-   The 4 day rental is for the Fiat:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    FourDays == Fiat.

-   Kathy Koch's reservation is either the 5 day reservation or the Fiat rental:
    This is a constraint that states that Kathy Koch's reservation is either 5 days or for the Fiat, but not both. So:
    Xor([KathyKoch == FiveDays, KathyKoch == Fiat]).

-   The 3 day rental, Irene Ingram's reservation, and Kathy Koch's reservation are all different rentals:
    This is a constraint that states that the 3-day rental, Irene Ingram's reservation, and Kathy Koch's reservation are all different. So:
    AllDifferent([ThreeDays, IreneIngram, KathyKoch]).

-   Ann Alexander's rental is for 4 days:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    AnnAlexander == FourDays.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if AnnAlexander == 1, and FourDays == 1, and Fiat == 1, then Ann Alexander's rental is for 4 days for the Fiat.

### Decision variables:

-   Length of the rental contracts: TwoDays, ThreeDays, FourDays, FiveDays (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Car models: Fiat, Kia, Nissan, Toyota (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The Kia rental is for a period 1 day shorter than the Toyota rental:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the rental lengths for Kia and Toyota, such that Kia's rental length is 1 less than Toyota's rental length. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    r1 == Kia and r2 == Toyota => r1_to_int == r2_to_int - 1, for all r1, r2 in contract lengths.

-   The 4 day rental is for the Fiat:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    FourDays == Fiat.

-   Kathy Koch's reservation is either the 5 day reservation or the Fiat rental:
    This is a constraint that states that Kathy Koch's reservation is either 5 days or for the Fiat, but not both. So:
    Xor([KathyKoch == FiveDays, KathyKoch == Fiat]).

-   The 3 day rental, Irene Ingram's reservation, and Kathy Koch's reservation are all different rentals:
    This is a constraint that states that the 3-day rental, Irene Ingram's reservation, and Kathy Koch's reservation are all different. So:
    AllDifferent([ThreeDays, IreneIngram, KathyKoch]).

-   Ann Alexander's rental is for 4 days:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:

### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Jonathan == 1, and LinkedIn68 == 1, and Facebook120 == 1, then Jonathan has 68 LinkedIn connections and 120 Facebook friends.

-   Yvonne has 20 fewer Facebook friends than Margie:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of Facebook friends for Yvonne and Margie, such that Yvonne has 20 fewer Facebook friends than Margie. So, the constraints will be of the form:

Clues:
The photo taken in April was published by Wildzone.
The shot of the giant tortoise was taken 1 month before the photo published by Science World.
The photo of the orangutan was published by The Geographer.
The photo of the snow leopard was taken 2 months after the photo published by The Geographer.

Entities:
animals: giant tortoise, orangutan, snow leopard, tree kangaroo
months: March, April, May, June
magazines: Earth Aware, Science World, The Geographer, Wildzone
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if GiantTortoise == 1, and March == 1, and Wildzone == 1, then the shot of the giant tortoise was taken in March and published by Wildzone.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the animals: GiantTortoise, Orangutan, SnowLeopard, TreeKangaroo (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Months of the photos: March, April, May, June (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Names of the magazines: EarthAware, ScienceWorld, TheGeographer, Wildzone (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The photo taken in April was published by Wildzone:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    April == Wildzone.

-   The shot of the giant tortoise was taken 1 month before the photo published by Science World:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months for the giant tortoise and Science World, such that the giant tortoise's photo month is 1 less than Science World's photo month. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == GiantTortoise and m2 == ScienceWorld => m1_to_int == m2_to_int - 1, for all m1, m2 in months.

-   The photo of the orangutan was published by The Geographer:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Orangutan == TheGeographer.

-   The photo of the snow leopard was taken 2 months after the photo published by The Geographer:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months for the snow leopard and The Geographer, such that the snow leopard's photo month is 2 more than The Geographer's photo month. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == SnowLeopard and m2 == TheGeographer => m1_to_int == m2_to_int + 2, for all m1, m2 in months.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if GiantTortoise == 1, and March == 1, and Wildzone == 1, then the shot of the giant tortoise was taken in March and published by Wildzone.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the animals: GiantTortoise, Orangutan, SnowLeopard, TreeKangaroo (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Months of the photos: March, April, May, June (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Names of the magazines: EarthAware, ScienceWorld, TheGeographer, Wildzone (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The photo taken in April was published by Wildzone:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    April == Wildzone.

-   The shot of the giant tortoise was taken 1 month before the photo published by Science World:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months for the giant tortoise and Science World, such that the giant tortoise's photo month is 1 less than Science World's photo month. So, the constraints will be of the form:

-   The photo of the orangutan was published by The Geographer:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Orangutan == TheGeographer.

-   The photo of the snow leopard was taken 2 months after the photo published by The Geographer:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months for the snow leopard and The Geographer, such that the snow leopard's photo month is 2 more than The Geographer's photo month. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == SnowLeopard and m2 == TheGeographer => m1_to_int == m2_to_int + 2, for all m1, m2 in months.

Clues:
Henrietta's job is either the chore that starts at 9:00am or the chore that starts at 8:00am.
Jack's task is either the job that starts at 8:00am or the living room assignment.
Jack's job starts at 10:00am.
Kay's chore starts at 8:00am.
Jack's assignment starts 2 hours after the mud room assignment.
The laundry room assignment, the chore that starts at 8:00am and the chore that starts at 11:00am are all different jobs.

Entities:
children: Henrietta, Jack, Kay, Zachary
times: 8:00am, 9:00am, 10:00am, 11:00am
rooms: dining room, laundry room, living room, mud room
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Henrietta == 1, and 9am == 1, and DiningRoom == 1, then Henrietta's chore starts at 9:00 am in the dining room.

-   Rooms for the chores: DiningRoom, LaundryRoom, LivingRoom, MudRoom (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   Henrietta's job is either the chore that starts at 9:00am or the chore that starts at 8:00am:
    This is a constraint that states that Henrietta's chore starts either at 9:00am or 8:00am, but not both. So:
    Xor([Henrietta == 9am, Henrietta == 8am]).

-   Jack's task is either the job that starts at 8:00am or the living room assignment:
    This is a constraint that states that Jack's chore starts either at 8:00am or in the living room, but not both. So:

-   Kay's chore starts at 8:00am:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Kay == 8am.

-   Jack's assignment starts 2 hours after the mud room assignment:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the times for Jack and the MudRoom, such that Jack's chore time is 2 hours after the MudRoom's chore time. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    t1 == Jack and t2 == MudRoom => t1_to_int == t2_to_int + 2, for all t1, t2 in times.

-   The laundry room assignment, the chore that starts at 8:00am, and the chore that starts at 11:00am are all different jobs:
    This is a constraint that states that the laundry room assignment, the chore that starts at 8:00am, and the chore that starts at 11:00am are all different. So:
    AllDifferent([LaundryRoom, 8am, 11am]).

-   Kay's chore starts at 8:00am:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:

Entities:
names: Angel, Charlie, Gracie, Merlin
wingspans: 102 inches, 106 inches, 110 inches, 114 inches
ages: 8, 9, 10, 11
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Angel == 1, and 102inches == 1, and Age8 == 1, then Angel is the bird with a wingspan of 102 inches and is 8 years old.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the birds: Angel, Charlie, Gracie, Merlin (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   Charlie is 9 years old:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:

-   Gracie has a wingspan of 114 inches:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Gracie == Wingspan114.

-   The 11-year-old bird has a wingspan 8 inches shorter than Charlie:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the wingspans for the 11-year-old bird and Charlie, such that the 11-year-old bird's wingspan is 8 inches shorter than Charlie's wingspan. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    w1 == Age11 and w2 == Charlie => w2_to_int == w1_to_int + 8, for all w1, w2 in wingspans.

-   Angel is either the 8-year-old bird or the bird with a wingspan of 114 inches:
    This is a constraint that states that Angel's age is either 8 years old or Angel has a wingspan of 114 inches, but not both. So:

### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Angel == 1, and 102inches == 1, and Age8 == 1, then Angel is the bird with a wingspan of 102 inches and is 8 years old.

Clues:
The TrustCo card has an APR of 11%.
The Southwest Inc card has a limit of $2,000.
The card with an APR of 11% is either the card with the $4,000 credit limit or the one with the $20,000 credit limit.
The card with an APR of 10% is either the card with the $4,000 credit limit or the TrustCo card.
The Credit Korp card has an APR 1 percent lower than the one with the $2,000 credit limit.

Entities:
credit cards: Credit Korp, Mid Atlantic, Southwest Inc, TrustCo
APR: 8%, 9%, 10%, 11%
credit limits: $2,000, $4,000, $5,000, $20,000
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if CreditKorp == 1, and 8% == 1, and $2,000 == 1, then Credit Korp has an APR of 8% and a credit limit of $2,000.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the credit cards: CreditKorp, MidAtlantic, SouthwestInc, TrustCo (all different, 1 to 4)
-   APRs of the credit cards: APR8, APR9, APR10, APR11 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Credit limits of the credit cards: $2,000, $4,000, $5,000, $20,000 (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The TrustCo card has an APR of 11%:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    TrustCo == APR11.

-   The Southwest Inc card has a limit of $2,000:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    SouthwestInc == $2,000.

-   The card with an APR of 11% is either the card with the $4,000 credit limit or the one with the $20,000 credit limit:
    This is a constraint that states that the card with an APR of 11% has a credit limit of either $4,000 or $20,000, but not both. So:
    Xor([APR11 == $4,000, APR11 == $20,000]).

-   The card with an APR of 10% is either the card with the $4,000 credit limit or the TrustCo card:
    This is a constraint that states that the card with an APR of 10% has a credit limit of $4,000 or is the TrustCo card, but not both. So:
    Xor([APR10 == $4,000, APR10 == TrustCo]).

-   The Credit Korp card has an APR 1 percent lower than the one with the $2,000 credit limit:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the APRs for Credit Korp and the card with the $2,000 credit limit, such that Credit Korp's APR is 1 percent lower than the APR of the $2,000 credit limit card. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    a1 == CreditKorp and a2 == $2,000 => a1_to_int == a2_to_int - 1, for all a1, a2 in APRs.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if CreditKorp == 1, and 8% == 1, and $2,000 == 1, then Credit Korp has an APR of 8% and a credit limit of $2,000.

### Decision variables:

-   Credit limits of the credit cards: $2,000, $4,000, $5,000, $20,000 (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The TrustCo card has an APR of 11%:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    TrustCo == APR11.

-   The Southwest Inc card has a limit of $2,000:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    SouthwestInc == $2,000.

-   The card with an APR of 11% is either the card with the $4,000 credit limit or the one with the $20,000 credit limit:
    This is a constraint that states that the card with an APR of 11% has a credit limit of either $4,000 or $20,000, but not both. So:
    Xor([APR11 == $4,000, APR11 == $20,000]).

-   The card with an APR of 10% is either the card with the $4,000 credit limit or the TrustCo card:
    This is a constraint that states that the card with an APR of 10% has a credit limit of $4,000 or is the TrustCo card, but not both. So:
    Xor([APR10 == $4,000, APR10 == TrustCo]).

-   The Credit Korp card has an APR 1 percent lower than the one with the $2,000 credit limit:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the APRs for Credit Korp and the card with the $2,000 credit limit, such that Credit Korp's APR is 1 percent lower than the APR of the $2,000 credit limit card. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    a1 == CreditKorp and a2 == $2,000 => a1_to_int == a2_to_int - 1, for all a1, a2 in APRs.

Clues:
The title due on September 22 is either Rosa's book or "Dancing Well".
Ebony's book was due 1 week after Rosa's book.
Aimee's book was due on September 15.
Ebony's book was "Heaven's Seal".
"Heaven's Seal" was due 1 week after "Frogs of Iowa".

Entities:
borrowers: Aimee, Ebony, Jimmy, Rosa
due dates: September 1, September 8, September 15, September 22
titles: Dancing Well, Frogs of Iowa, Heaven's Seal, Time to Burn
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Aimee == 1, and September15 == 1, and TimeToBurn == 1, then Aimee's book is "Time to Burn" and is due on September 15.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the borrowers: Aimee, Ebony, Jimmy, Rosa (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Due dates of the books: September1, September8, September15, September22 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Titles of the books: DancingWell, FrogsOfIowa, HeavensSeal, TimeToBurn (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The title due on September 22 is either Rosa's book or "Dancing Well":
    This is a constraint that states that the book due on September 22 is either Rosa's book or "Dancing Well", but not both. So:
    Xor([September22 == Rosa, September22 == DancingWell]).

-   Ebony's book was due 1 week after Rosa's book:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the due dates for Ebony's book and Rosa's book, such that Ebony's book's due date is 1 week after Rosa's book's due date. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    d1 == Ebony and d2 == Rosa => d1_to_int == d2_to_int + 7, for all d1, d2 in due dates.

-   Aimee's book was due on September 15:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Aimee == September15.

-   Ebony's book was "Heaven's Seal":
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Ebony == HeavensSeal.

-   "Heaven's Seal" was due 1 week after "Frogs of Iowa":
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the due dates for "Heaven's Seal" and "Frogs of Iowa", such that "Heaven's Seal"'s due date is 1 week after "Frogs of Iowa"'s due date. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    d1 == HeavensSeal and d2 == FrogsOfIowa => d1_to_int == d2_to_int + 7, for all d1, d2 in due dates.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing.

    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the due dates for Ebony's book and Rosa's book, such that Ebony's book's due date is 1 week after Rosa's book's due date. So, the constraints will be of the form:

The siren released in 1997 is 10 decibels louder than the siren released in 1996.
The siren released in 2009 is either the Armor-Stop or the Viking 5.
The siren released in 1997 is either the Soundarm or the Viking 5.
The Armor-Stop is louder than the siren released in 2009.
The Soundarm is 110 decibels loud.

Entities:
sirens: Armor-Stop, Rip Tide, Soundarm, Viking 5
decibels: 100 decibels, 105 decibels, 110 decibels, 115 decibels
years: 1996, 1997, 2000, 2009
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Armor-Stop == 1, and 100decibels == 1, and Year1996 == 1, then Armor-Stop is the siren released in 1996 with a loudness of 100 decibels.

### Decision variables:

### Constraints:
-   The siren released in 1997 is 10 decibels louder than the siren released in 1996:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the loudness for the sirens released in 1996 and 1997, such that the loudness of the siren released in 1997 is 10 decibels greater. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    d1 == Year1996 and d2 == Year1997 => d2_to_int == d1_to_int + 10, for all d1, d2 in decibels.

-   The siren released in 2009 is either the Armor-Stop or the Viking 5:
    This is a constraint that states that the siren released in 2009 is either Armor-Stop or Viking 5, but not both. So:

-   The Armor-Stop is louder than the siren released in 2009:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the loudness for the Armor-Stop and the siren released in 2009, such that the loudness of Armor-Stop is greater. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    d1 == Armor-Stop and d2 == Year2009 => d1_to_int > d2_to_int, for all d1, d2 in decibels.

-   The Soundarm is 110 decibels loud:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Soundarm == Decibels110.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Armor-Stop == 1, and 100decibels == 1, and Year1996 == 1, then Armor-Stop is the siren released in 1996 with a loudness of 100 decibels.

-   Hope paid $8:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Hope == Price8.

-   Norman paid less than Opal:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the prices for Norman and Opal, such that Norman's price is less than Opal's price. So, the constraints will be of the form:

-   The one who had the cafe mocha paid 2 dollars more than Norman:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the prices for the one who had the cafe mocha and Norman, such that the cafe mocha's price is 2 dollars more than Norman's price. So, the constraints will be of the form:

Clues:
The ring with the aquamarine cost less than the piece with the diamond.
Opal's ring is either the piece that cost $1300 or the piece with the diamond.
The piece that cost $1400 is either the ring with the ruby or Hazel's ring.
Hazel's ring has the diamond.
Becky's piece cost more than the ring with the diamond.

Entities:
customers: Becky, Hazel, Opal, Yolanda
prices: $1100, $1200, $1300, $1400
stones: aquamarine, diamond, ruby, topaz
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Becky == 1, and Price1100 == 1, and Aquamarine == 1, then Becky bought the piece with the aquamarine for $1100.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the customers: Becky, Hazel, Opal, Yolanda (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Prices of the pieces: Price1100, Price1200, Price1300, Price1400 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Stones in the pieces: Aquamarine, Diamond, Ruby, Topaz (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The ring with the aquamarine cost less than the piece with the diamond:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of prices to the aquamarine and diamond pieces, such that the aquamarine piece's price is less than the diamond piece's price. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Aquamarine and p2 == Diamond => p1_to_int < p2_to_int, for all p1, p2 in prices.

-   Opal's ring is either the piece that cost $1300 or the piece with the diamond:
    This is a constraint that states that Opal's piece is either the $1300 piece or the diamond piece, but not both. Thus:
    Xor([Opal == Price1300, Opal == Diamond]).

-   The piece that cost $1400 is either the ring with the ruby or Hazel's ring:
    This is a constraint that states that the $1400 piece is either the ruby piece or Hazel's piece, but not both. Thus:
    Xor([Price1400 == Ruby, Price1400 == Hazel]).

-   Hazel's ring has the diamond:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Hazel == Diamond.

-   Becky's piece cost more than the ring with the diamond:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of prices to Becky's piece and the diamond ring, such that Becky's piece's price is greater than the diamond ring's price. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Becky and p2 == Diamond => p1_to_int > p2_to_int, for all p1, p2 in prices.
### Plan:

-   The piece that cost $1400 is either the ring with the ruby or Hazel's ring:

Ollie's pet is the wood frog.
The tree frog was bought 2 months after Ollie's pet.
Joann's pet is either the wood frog or the tree frog.
Ida's pet is either the animal bought in April or the bullfrog.

Entities:
names: Ida, Joann, Nettie, Ollie
months: January, February, March, April
amphibians: bullfrog, horned toad, tree frog, wood frog
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Ida == 1, and January == 1, and Bullfrog == 1, then Ida's pet is the bullfrog bought in January.

### Decision variables:

-   Months of purchase: January, February, March, April (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Types of amphibians: Bullfrog, HornedToad, TreeFrog, WoodFrog (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The wood frog was bought 1 month after Nettie's pet:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months of purchase for Nettie's pet and the wood frog, such that the wood frog's month of purchase is 1 more than Nettie's pet's month of purchase. So, the constraints will be of the form:

-   Ollie's pet is the wood frog:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Ollie == WoodFrog.

-   The tree frog was bought 2 months after Ollie's pet:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months of purchase for Ollie's pet and the tree frog, such that the tree frog's month of purchase is 2 more than Ollie's pet's month of purchase. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == Ollie's pet and m2 == TreeFrog => m2_to_int == m1_to_int + 2, for all m1, m2 in months of purchase.

-   Joann's pet is either the wood frog or the tree frog:
    This is a constraint that states that Joann's pet is either the wood frog or the tree frog, but not both. So:

-   Ida's pet is either the animal bought in April or the bullfrog:
    This is a constraint that states that Ida's pet is either the animal bought in April or the bullfrog, but not both. So:

Clues:
Winifred spoke for a somewhat shorter time than Omar.
Neal talked about Diocletian.
The four students were the presenter who spoke for 8 minutes, the student who gave the presentation on Galerius, Neal and Vickie.
The student who gave the presentation on Nero spoke 2 minutes more than Vickie.
Omar was either the presenter who gave the presentation on Nero or the presenter who spoke for 10 minutes.

Entities:
names: Neal, Omar, Vickie, Winifred
lengths: 6 minutes, 8 minutes, 10 minutes, 12 minutes
emperors: Diocletian, Galerius, Licinius, Nero
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Neal == 1, and 8minutes == 1, and Diocletian == 1, then Neal talked about Diocletian for 8 minutes.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the presenters: Neal, Omar, Vickie, Winifred (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Lengths of the presentations: Length6, Length8, Length10, Length12 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Emperors discussed: Diocletian, Galerius, Licinius, Nero (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   Winifred spoke for a somewhat shorter time than Omar:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the lengths for Winifred and Omar, such that Winifred's length is somewhat shorter than Omar's length. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    l1 == Winifred and l2 == Omar => l1_to_int == l2_to_int - 1, for all l1, l2 in lengths.

-   Neal talked about Diocletian:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Neal == Diocletian.

-   The four students were the presenter who spoke for 8 minutes, the student who gave the presentation on Galerius, Neal, and Vickie:
    This constraint ensures that each of the four students is assigned one of the specified lengths or emperors. So, we will have the following constraints:
    AllDifferent([Length8, Galerius, Neal, Vickie]).

-   The student who gave the presentation on Nero spoke 2 minutes more than Vickie:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the lengths for the presenter on Nero and Vickie, such that the presenter on Nero's length is 2 minutes more than Vickie's length. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    l1 == Nero and l2 == Vickie => l1_to_int == l2_to_int + 2, for all l1, l2 in lengths.

-   Omar was either the presenter who gave the presentation on Nero or the presenter who spoke for 10 minutes:
    This is a constraint that states that Omar's presentation is either about Nero or Omar spoke for 10 minutes, but not both. So:
    Xor([Omar == Nero, Omar == Length10]).
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Neal == 1, and 8minutes == 1, and Diocletian == 1, then Neal talked about Diocletian for 8 minutes.

### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Della == 1, and Fare6 == 1, and ArcticBuilding == 1, then Della paid $6 and was picked up at the Arctic Building.

### Constraints:
-   Rosa paid somewhat more than the customer who got picked up at the Smith Tower:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of fares to Rosa and the customer picked up at the Smith Tower, such that Rosa's fare is greater than the fare of the customer picked up at the Smith Tower. So, the constraints will be of the form:

-   Neil paid 3 dollars more than Rosa:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of fares to Neil and Rosa, such that Neil's fare is 3 dollars more than Rosa's fare. So, the constraints will be of the form:

Clues:
The facility scheduled to go online in 2019 is either the Egert Facility or the project headed by Dr. Alvarez.
The project headed by Dr. Morgan is either the Zynga Complex or the facility scheduled to go online in 2019.
The project headed by Dr. Salinas will go online 1 year before the Egert Facility.
The project headed by Dr. Alvarez will go online sometime after the project headed by Dr. Noble.
The project headed by Dr. Salinas will go online sometime before the project headed by Dr. Noble.
The project headed by Dr. Morgan will go online sometime after the Bale-Hahn SSC.

Entities:
names: Bale-Hahn SSC, Egert Facility, Lectra 4C, Zynga Complex
years: 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019
scientists: Dr. Alvarez, Dr. Morgan, Dr. Noble, Dr. Salinas
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if BaleHahnSSC == 1, and 2016 == 1, and DrAlvarez == 1, then the Bale-Hahn SSC project, headed by Dr. Alvarez, went online in 2016.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the projects: BaleHahnSSC, EgertFacility, Lectra4C, ZyngaComplex (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Years the projects go online: Year2016, Year2017, Year2018, Year2019 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Names of the scientists: DrAlvarez, DrMorgan, DrNoble, DrSalinas (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The facility scheduled to go online in 2019 is either the Egert Facility or the project headed by Dr. Alvarez:
    This is a constraint that states that the project going online in 2019 is either the Egert Facility or the project headed by Dr. Alvarez, but not both. So:
    Xor([Year2019 == EgertFacility, Year2019 == DrAlvarez]).

-   The project headed by Dr. Morgan is either the Zynga Complex or the facility scheduled to go online in 2019:
    This is a constraint that states that the project headed by Dr. Morgan is either the Zynga Complex or the project going online in 2019, but not both. So:
    Xor([DrMorgan == ZyngaComplex, DrMorgan == Year2019]).

-   The project headed by Dr. Salinas will go online 1 year before the Egert Facility:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the years for Dr. Salinas's project and the Egert Facility, such that Dr. Salinas's project's year is 1 less than the Egert Facility's year. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    y1 == DrSalinas and y2 == EgertFacility => y1_to_int == y2_to_int - 1, for all y1, y2 in years.

-   The project headed by Dr. Alvarez will go online sometime after the project headed by Dr. Noble:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the years for Dr. Alvarez's project and Dr. Noble's project, such that Dr. Alvarez's project's year is greater than Dr. Noble's project's year. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    y1 == DrAlvarez and y2 == DrNoble => y1_to_int > y2_to_int, for all y1, y2 in years.

-   The project headed by Dr. Salinas will go online sometime before the project headed by Dr. Noble:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the years for Dr. Salinas's project and Dr. Noble's project, such that Dr. Salinas's project's year is less than Dr. Noble's project's year. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    y1 == DrSalinas and y2 == DrNoble => y1_to_int < y2_to_int, for all y1, y2 in years.

-   The project headed by Dr. Morgan will go online sometime after the Bale-Hahn SSC:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the years for Dr. Morgan's project and the Bale-Hahn SSC, such that Dr. Morgan's project's year is greater than the Bale-Hahn SSC's year. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    y1 == DrMorgan and y2 == BaleHahnSSC => y1_to_int > y2_to_int, for all y1, y2 in years.

Clues:
Lillian scored 6 points higher than Bessie.
The dancer who performed first scored 3 points lower than the dancer who performed ninth.
Verna scored somewhat higher than the person who danced third.
The dancer who performed seventh scored 6 points higher than the person who danced ninth.

Entities:
names: Bessie, Clara, Lillian, Verna
points: 181 points, 184 points, 187 points, 190 points
orders: first, third, seventh, ninth
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Bessie == 1, and 181points == 1, and First == 1, then Bessie is the dancer who performed first and scored 181 points.

### Decision variables:

-   Orders of the performances: First, Third, Seventh, Ninth (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   Lillian scored 6 points higher than Bessie:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the points for Lillian and Bessie, such that Lillian's points are 6 points higher than Bessie's points. So, the constraints will be of the form:

-   The dancer who performed first scored 3 points lower than the dancer who performed ninth:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the points for the first and ninth performers, such that the first performer's points are 3 points lower than the ninth performer's points. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == First and p2 == Ninth => p1_to_int == p2_to_int - 3, for all p1, p2 in points.

-   Verna scored somewhat higher than the person who danced third:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the points for Verna and the third performer, such that Verna's points are higher than the third performer's points. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Verna and p2 == Third => p1_to_int > p2_to_int, for all p1, p2 in points.

-   The dancer who performed seventh scored 6 points higher than the person who danced ninth:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the points for the seventh and ninth performers, such that the seventh performer's points are 6 points higher than the ninth performer's points. So, the constraints will be of the form:

    This is a constraint that states that the 200 page project is either from 2011 or 2010, but not both. So:
    Xor([200 pages == 2011, 200 pages == 2010]).

-   The book published in 2011 is either Orlando's project or Jan's project:
    This is a constraint that states that the book published in 2011 is either Orlando's or Jan's project, but not both. So:
    Xor([2011 == Orlando, 2011 == Jan]).

-   The book published in 2007 is 25 pages shorter than the book published in 2002:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the pages for the books published in 2007 and 2002, such that the book published in 2007 has 25 pages less than the book published in 2002. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == 2007 and p2 == 2002 => p2_to_int == p1_to_int + 25, for all p1, p2 in pages.

-   The four projects are the book published in 2007, the 225 page assignment, Suzanne's project, and the 175 page assignment:
    This is a constraint that states the four projects are the specified ones. So:
    AllDifferent([2007, 225 pages, Suzanne, 175 pages]).

-   Jan's assignment is 175 pages long:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Jan == 175 pages.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Ebony == 1, and 2002 == 1, and 150 pages == 1, then Ebony's project is the book published in 2002 with 150 pages.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the translators: Ebony, Jan, Orlando, Suzanne (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Number of pages of the projects: 150 pages, 175 pages, 200 pages, 225 pages (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Years of publication: 2002, 2007, 2010, 2011 (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The 200 page project is either the book published in 2011 or the book published in 2010:
    This is a constraint that states that the 200 page project is either from 2011 or 2010, but not both. So:
    Xor([200 pages == 2011, 200 pages == 2010]).

-   The book published in 2011 is either Orlando's project or Jan's project:
    This is a constraint that states that the book published in 2011 is either Orlando's or Jan's project, but not both. So:
    Xor([2011 == Orlando, 2011 == Jan]).

-   The book published in 2007 is 25 pages shorter than the book published in 2002:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the pages for the books published in 2007 and 2002, such that the book published in 2007 has 25 pages less than the book published in 2002. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == 2007 and p2 == 2002 => p2_to_int == p1_to_int + 25, for all p1, p2 in pages.

-   Jan's assignment is 175 pages long:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Jan == 175 pages.

Clues:
Mrs. Danielson's cake will be delivered 1 day before the order shaped like a sports car.
The order shaped like a turtle will be delivered 2 days before Mrs. Ingram's cake.
The cake shaped like a bowling pin is either the October 5 delivery or Mrs. Ingram's cake.
Mrs. Nolan's cake will be in the shape of a sports car.
The October 7 delivery will be in the shape of a bowling pin.

Entities:
customers: Danielson, Estrada, Ingram, Nolan
delivery dates: October 5, October 6, October 7, October 8
cake shapes: baseball glove, bowling pin, sports car, turtle
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Danielson == 1, and October5 == 1, and BaseballGlove == 1, then Mrs. Danielson's baseball glove-shaped cake will be delivered on October 5.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the customers: Danielson, Estrada, Ingram, Nolan (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Delivery dates: October5, October6, October7, October8 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Cake shapes: BaseballGlove, BowlingPin, SportsCar, Turtle (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   Mrs. Danielson's cake will be delivered 1 day before the order shaped like a sports car:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the delivery dates for Mrs. Danielson's cake and the sports car-shaped cake, such that Mrs. Danielson's delivery date is 1 less than the sports car-shaped cake's delivery date. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    d1 == Danielson and d2 == SportsCar => d1_to_int == d2_to_int - 1, for all d1, d2 in delivery dates.

-   The order shaped like a turtle will be delivered 2 days before Mrs. Ingram's cake:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the delivery dates for the turtle-shaped cake and Mrs. Ingram's cake, such that the turtle-shaped cake's delivery date is 2 less than Mrs. Ingram's cake's delivery date. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    d1 == Turtle and d2 == Ingram => d1_to_int == d2_to_int - 2, for all d1, d2 in delivery dates.

-   The cake shaped like a bowling pin is either the October 5 delivery or Mrs. Ingram's cake:
    This is a constraint that states that the cake shaped like a bowling pin's delivery date is either October 5 or Mrs. Ingram's cake's delivery date, but not both. So:
    Xor([BowlingPin == October5, BowlingPin == Ingram]).

-   Mrs. Nolan's cake will be in the shape of a sports car:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Nolan == SportsCar.

-   The October 7 delivery will be in the shape of a bowling pin:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    October7 == BowlingPin.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Danielson == 1, and October5 == 1, and BaseballGlove == 1, then Mrs. Danielson's baseball glove-shaped cake will be delivered on October 5.

    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the delivery dates for Mrs. Danielson's cake and the sports car-shaped cake, such that Mrs. Danielson's delivery date is 1 less than the sports car-shaped cake's delivery date. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    d1 == Danielson and d2 == SportsCar => d1_to_int == d2_to_int - 1, for all d1, d2 in delivery dates.

-   The order shaped like a turtle will be delivered 2 days before Mrs. Ingram's cake:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the delivery dates for the turtle-shaped cake and Mrs. Ingram's cake, such that the turtle-shaped cake's delivery date is 2 less than Mrs. Ingram's cake's delivery date. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    d1 == Turtle and d2 == Ingram => d1_to_int == d2_to_int - 2, for all d1, d2 in delivery dates.

-   The cake shaped like a bowling pin is either the October 5 delivery or Mrs. Ingram's cake:
    This is a constraint that states that the cake shaped like a bowling pin's delivery date is either October 5 or Mrs. Ingram's cake's delivery date, but not both. So:
    Xor([BowlingPin == October5, BowlingPin == Ingram]).

-   Mrs. Nolan's cake will be in the shape of a sports car:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Nolan == SportsCar.

-   The October 7 delivery will be in the shape of a bowling pin:

Wilcox Arena holds 80 fewer people than the soccer facility.

Entities:
arenas: Frederick, Ingram, Noble, Wilcox
capacities: 110, 150, 190, 230
sports: basketball, lacrosse, rugby, soccer
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Frederick == 1, and 230 == 1, and Basketball == 1, then Frederick is the basketball facility with a capacity of 230 people.

### Decision variables:

-   Types of sports: Basketball, Lacrosse, Rugby, Soccer (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   Of Ingram Arena and Noble Arena, one holds 150 people and the other is set up for rugby games:
    This is a constraint that states that one of Ingram Arena and Noble Arena holds 150 people and the other is set up for rugby games. So, the constraints will be:
    (Ingram == Capacity150 and Noble == Rugby) or (Ingram == Rugby and Noble == Capacity150).

-   The lacrosse facility holds 40 more people than Wilcox Arena:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the capacities for the lacrosse facility and Wilcox Arena, such that the lacrosse facility's capacity is 40 more than Wilcox Arena's capacity. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    c1 == Lacrosse and c2 == Wilcox => c1_to_int == c2_to_int + 40, for all c1, c2 in capacities.

-   Ingram Arena holds 230 people:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Ingram == Capacity230.

-   Wilcox Arena holds 80 fewer people than the soccer facility:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the capacities for Wilcox Arena and the soccer facility, such that Wilcox Arena's capacity is 80 less than the soccer facility's capacity. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    c1 == Wilcox and c2 == Soccer => c1_to_int == c2_to_int - 80, for all c1, c2 in capacities.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing.

    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the capacities for the lacrosse facility and Wilcox Arena, such that the lacrosse facility's capacity is 40 more than Wilcox Arena's capacity. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    c1 == Lacrosse and c2 == Wilcox => c1_to_int == c2_to_int + 40, for all c1, c2 in capacities.

-   Ingram Arena holds 230 people:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:

### Constraints:
-   The $35,000 structure is 15 sq ft smaller than the $29,000 home:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of prices to the $35,000 and $29,000 houses, such that the $35,000 house is 15 sq ft smaller than the $29,000 house. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Price35000 and p2 == Price29000 => s1 == s2 - 15, for all p1, p2 in prices and s1, s2 in sq footage.

-   The Whitehead's structure sold for $29,000:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Whitehead == Price29000.

-   The Kirby's house is 15 sq ft smaller than the $35,000 house:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of prices to the Kirby's house and the $35,000 house, such that the Kirby's house is 15 sq ft smaller than the $35,000 house. So, the constraints will be of the form:

-   The $36,000 house is somewhat smaller than the Gillespie's structure:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of prices to the $36,000 house and the Gillespie's house, such that the $36,000 house is somewhat smaller than the Gillespie's house. So, the constraints will be of the form:

-   Of the 110 sq ft home and the 140 sq ft home, one sold for $35,000 and the other is for the Gillespies:
    This is a constraint that states that one of the houses with 110 sq ft and 140 sq ft was sold for $35,000 and the other was bought by the Gillespies. Thus:
    (SqFt110 == Price35000 and SqFt140 == Gillespie) or (SqFt110 == Gillespie and SqFt140 == Price35000).
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Gillespie == 1, and Price25000 == 1, and SqFt95 == 1, then Gillespie bought the 95 sq ft house for $25,000.

    This is a direct assignment constraint:

    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of prices to the Kirby's house and the $35,000 house, such that the Kirby's house is 15 sq ft smaller than the $35,000 house. So, the constraints will be of the form:

Clues:
The Nielsen's house is 30 sq ft larger than the $35,000 structure.
The 125 sq ft home is either the Whitehead's home or the $32,250 home.
The Whitehead's house sold for $29,000.
The Ewing's home sold for $32,250.
The $29,000 house is somewhat smaller than the $32,250 structure.

Entities:
customers: Ewing, Kirby, Nielsen, Whitehead
sq footage: 95 sq ft, 110 sq ft, 125 sq ft, 140 sq ft
prices: $27,500, $29,000, $32,250, $35,000
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Ewing == 1, and Price27500 == 1, and SqFt95 == 1, then Ewing's home, which is 95 sq ft, was sold for $27,500.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the customers: Ewing, Kirby, Nielsen, Whitehead (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Square footage of the homes: SqFt95, SqFt110, SqFt125, SqFt140 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Prices of the homes: Price27500, Price29000, Price32250, Price35000 (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The Nielsen's house is 30 sq ft larger than the $35,000 structure:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of square footage to Nielsen's house and the $35,000 structure, such that Nielsen's house is 30 sq ft larger than the $35,000 structure. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    s1 == Nielsen and s2 == Price35000 => s1_to_int == s2_to_int + 30, for all s1, s2 in sq footage.

-   The 125 sq ft home is either the Whitehead's home or the $32,250 home:
    This is a constraint that states that the 125 sq ft home is either Whitehead's home or the $32,250 home, but not both. Thus:
    Xor([SqFt125 == Whitehead, SqFt125 == Price32250]).

-   The Whitehead's house sold for $29,000:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Whitehead == Price29000.

-   The Ewing's home sold for $32,250:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Ewing == Price32250.

-   The $29,000 house is somewhat smaller than the $32,250 structure:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of prices to the $29,000 house and the $32,250 structure, such that the $29,000 house is somewhat smaller than the $32,250 structure. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Price29000 and p2 == Price32250 => p1_to_int < p2_to_int.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Ewing == 1, and Price27500 == 1, and SqFt95 == 1, then Ewing's home, which is 95 sq ft, was sold for $27,500.

-   The 125 sq ft home is either the Whitehead's home or the $32,250 home:
    This is a constraint that states that the 125 sq ft home is either Whitehead's home or the $32,250 home, but not both. Thus:
    Xor([SqFt125 == Whitehead, SqFt125 == Price32250]).

-   The Whitehead's house sold for $29,000:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Whitehead == Price29000.

-   The Ewing's home sold for $32,250:

    Ewing == Price32250.

Clues:
Of the bird bought in February and the bird bought in January, one is Gladys's and the other is the macaw.
The macaw was bought 2 months before Ellen's pet.
The parakeet was bought 1 month after the finch.
Alberta's pet was bought 1 month before Gladys's pet.
The finch was bought sometime after the lovebird.

Entities:
names: Alberta, Della, Ellen, Gladys
months: January, February, March, April
birds: finch, lovebird, macaw, parakeet
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Alberta == 1, and January == 1, and Finch == 1, then Alberta's pet is the finch bought in January.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the individuals: Alberta, Della, Ellen, Gladys (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Months of purchase: January, February, March, April (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Types of birds: Finch, Lovebird, Macaw, Parakeet (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   Of the bird bought in February and the bird bought in January, one is Gladys's and the other is the macaw:
    This is a constraint that states that one of the birds bought in February and January is Gladys's and the other is the macaw, but not both. So:
    Xor([February == Gladys and January == Macaw, January == Gladys and February == Macaw]).

-   The macaw was bought 2 months before Ellen's pet:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months of purchase for the macaw and Ellen's pet, such that the macaw's month of purchase is 2 less than Ellen's pet's month of purchase. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == Macaw and m2 == Ellen'sPet => m1_to_int == m2_to_int - 2, for all m1, m2 in months of purchase.

-   The parakeet was bought 1 month after the finch:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months of purchase for the finch and the parakeet, such that the parakeet's month of purchase is 1 more than the finch's month of purchase. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == Finch and m2 == Parakeet => m1_to_int == m2_to_int - 1, for all m1, m2 in months of purchase.

-   Alberta's pet was bought 1 month before Gladys's pet:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months of purchase for Alberta's pet and Gladys's pet, such that Alberta's pet's month of purchase is 1 less than Gladys's pet's month of purchase. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == Alberta'sPet and m2 == Gladys'sPet => m1_to_int == m2_to_int - 1, for all m1, m2 in months of purchase.

-   The finch was bought sometime after the lovebird:
    This is a constraint that states that the finch was bought after the lovebird, so:
    Finch > Lovebird.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Alberta == 1, and January == 1, and Finch == 1, then Alberta's pet is the finch bought in January.

    This is a constraint that states that one of the birds bought in February and January is Gladys's and the other is the macaw, but not both. So:
    Xor([February == Gladys and January == Macaw, January == Gladys and February == Macaw]).

-   The macaw was bought 2 months before Ellen's pet:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months of purchase for the macaw and Ellen's pet, such that the macaw's month of purchase is 2 less than Ellen's pet's month of purchase. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == Macaw and m2 == Ellen'sPet => m1_to_int == m2_to_int - 2, for all m1, m2 in months of purchase.

-   The parakeet was bought 1 month after the finch:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months of purchase for the finch and the parakeet, such that the parakeet's month of purchase is 1 more than the finch's month of purchase. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == Finch and m2 == Parakeet => m1_to_int == m2_to_int - 1, for all m1, m2 in months of purchase.

-   Alberta's pet was bought 1 month before Gladys's pet:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the months of purchase for Alberta's pet and Gladys's pet, such that Alberta's pet's month of purchase is 1 less than Gladys's pet's month of purchase. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    m1 == Alberta'sPet and m2 == Gladys'sPet => m1_to_int == m2_to_int - 1, for all m1, m2 in months of purchase.

-   The finch was bought sometime after the lovebird:
    This is a constraint that states that the finch was bought after the lovebird, so:
    Finch > Lovebird.

Clues:
The Tevatron LHC is either the facility scheduled to go online in 2019 or the accelerator scheduled to go online in 2016.
Of the project headed by Dr. Baldwin and the project headed by Dr. Quinn, one is the Falston LCS and the other will go online in 2017.
The project headed by Dr. Ewing will go online sometime before the Zynga Complex.
Of the project headed by Dr. Ewing and the facility scheduled to go online in 2018, one is the Egert Facility and the other is the Tevatron LHC.
The Zynga Complex is headed by Dr. Baldwin.

Entities:
names: Egert Facility, Falston LCS, Tevatron LHC, Zynga Complex
years: 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019
scientists: Dr. Baldwin, Dr. Ewing, Dr. Kirk, Dr. Quinn
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if EgertFacility == 1, and 2016 == 1, and DrBaldwin == 1, then the Egert Facility project, headed by Dr. Baldwin, went online in 2016.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the projects/facilities: EgertFacility, FalstonLCS, TevatronLHC, ZyngaComplex (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Years the projects/facilities go online: Year2016, Year2017, Year2018, Year2019 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Names of the scientists: DrBaldwin, DrEwing, DrKirk, DrQuinn (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The Tevatron LHC is either the facility scheduled to go online in 2019 or the accelerator scheduled to go online in 2016:
    This constraint states that Tevatron LHC is either in 2019 or in 2016. So, we can represent this as:
    Or([TevatronLHC == Year2019, TevatronLHC == Year2016]).

-   Of the project headed by Dr. Baldwin and the project headed by Dr. Quinn, one is the Falston LCS and the other will go online in 2017:
    This constraint states that one of the projects is Falston LCS and the other goes online in 2017. So, we can represent this as:
    (DrBaldwin == FalstonLCS and DrQuinn != FalstonLCS) or (DrBaldwin != FalstonLCS and DrQuinn == FalstonLCS) and (Year2017 == DrBaldwin or Year2017 == DrQuinn).

-   The project headed by Dr. Ewing will go online sometime before the Zynga Complex:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the years for Dr. Ewing's project and the Zynga Complex, such that Dr. Ewing's project's year is less than the Zynga Complex's year. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    y1 == DrEwing and y2 == ZyngaComplex => y1_to_int < y2_to_int, for all y1, y2 in years.

-   Of the project headed by Dr. Ewing and the facility scheduled to go online in 2018, one is the Egert Facility and the other is the Tevatron LHC:
    This constraint states that one of the projects is the Egert Facility and the other is the Tevatron LHC. So, we can represent this as:
    (DrEwing == EgertFacility and Year2018 == TevatronLHC) or (DrEwing == TevatronLHC and Year2018 == EgertFacility).

-   The Zynga Complex is headed by Dr. Baldwin:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    ZyngaComplex == DrBaldwin.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if EgertFacility == 1, and 2016 == 1, and DrBaldwin == 1, then the Egert Facility project, headed by Dr. Baldwin, went online in 2016.

-   Names of the scientists: DrBaldwin, DrEwing, DrKirk, DrQuinn (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The Tevatron LHC is either the facility scheduled to go online in 2019 or the accelerator scheduled to go online in 2016:
    This constraint states that Tevatron LHC is either in 2019 or in 2016. So, we can represent this as:
    Or([TevatronLHC == Year2019, TevatronLHC == Year2016]).

-   Of the project headed by Dr. Baldwin and the project headed by Dr. Quinn, one is the Falston LCS and the other will go online in 2017:
    This constraint states that one of the projects is Falston LCS and the other goes online in 2017. So, we can represent this as:
    (DrBaldwin == FalstonLCS and DrQuinn != FalstonLCS) or (DrBaldwin != FalstonLCS and DrQuinn == FalstonLCS) and (Year2017 == DrBaldwin or Year2017 == DrQuinn).

-   The project headed by Dr. Ewing will go online sometime before the Zynga Complex:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the years for Dr. Ewing's project and the Zynga Complex, such that Dr. Ewing's project's year is less than the Zynga Complex's year. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    y1 == DrEwing and y2 == ZyngaComplex => y1_to_int < y2_to_int, for all y1, y2 in years.

-   Of the project headed by Dr. Ewing and the facility scheduled to go online in 2018, one is the Egert Facility and the other is the Tevatron LHC:
    This constraint states that one of the projects is the Egert Facility and the other is the Tevatron LHC. So, we can represent this as:
    (DrEwing == EgertFacility and Year2018 == TevatronLHC) or (DrEwing == TevatronLHC and Year2018 == EgertFacility).

Clues:
The 2004 holiday is either the skydiving holiday or the holiday with Yvonne.
Of the kayaking holiday and the trip with Isabel, one was in 2001 and the other was in 2004.
The vacation with Andy was after the trip with Yvonne.
The holiday with Bill was 1 year after the trip with Andy.
The cycling trip was before the hunting vacation.

Entities:
friends: Andy, Bill, Isabel, Yvonne
years: 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004
activities: cycling, hunting, kayaking, skydiving
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Andy == 1, and 2001 == 1, and Cycling == 1, then Andy went on a cycling trip in 2001.

### Decision variables:
-   Friends: Andy, Bill, Isabel, Yvonne (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Years: 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Activities: Cycling, Hunting, Kayaking, Skydiving (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The 2004 holiday is either the skydiving holiday or the holiday with Yvonne:
    This is a constraint that states that the 2004 holiday is either the skydiving holiday or the holiday with Yvonne, but not both. So:
    Xor([2004 == Skydiving, 2004 == Yvonne]).

-   The kayaking holiday and the trip with Isabel were in different years (2001 and 2004):
    This is a constraint that states that the kayaking holiday was in 2001 and the trip with Isabel was in 2004, but not both. So:
    Xor([Kayaking == 2001, Isabel == 2004]).

-   The vacation with Andy was after the trip with Yvonne:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the years for the vacation with Andy and the trip with Yvonne, such that Andy's vacation year is after Yvonne's trip year. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    y1 == Andy and y2 == Yvonne => y1_to_int > y2_to_int, for all y1, y2 in years.

-   The holiday with Bill was 1 year after the trip with Andy:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the years for the holiday with Bill and the trip with Andy, such that Bill's holiday year is 1 year after Andy's trip year. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    y1 == Bill and y2 == Andy => y1_to_int == y2_to_int + 1, for all y1, y2 in years.

-   The cycling trip was before the hunting vacation:
    This is a constraint that states that the cycling trip was before the hunting vacation. So:
    Cycling < Hunting.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Andy == 1, and 2001 == 1, and Cycling == 1, then Andy went on a cycling trip in 2001.

-   Activities: Cycling, Hunting, Kayaking, Skydiving (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The 2004 holiday is either the skydiving holiday or the holiday with Yvonne:
    This is a constraint that states that the 2004 holiday is either the skydiving holiday or the holiday with Yvonne, but not both. So:
    Xor([2004 == Skydiving, 2004 == Yvonne]).

-   The kayaking holiday and the trip with Isabel were in different years (2001 and 2004):
    This is a constraint that states that the kayaking holiday was in 2001 and the trip with Isabel was in 2004, but not both. So:
    Xor([Kayaking == 2001, Isabel == 2004]).

-   The vacation with Andy was after the trip with Yvonne:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the years for the vacation with Andy and the trip with Yvonne, such that Andy's vacation year is after Yvonne's trip year. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    y1 == Andy and y2 == Yvonne => y1_to_int > y2_to_int, for all y1, y2 in years.

-   The holiday with Bill was 1 year after the trip with Andy:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the years for the holiday with Bill and the trip with Andy, such that Bill's holiday year is 1 year after Andy's trip year. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    y1 == Bill and y2 == Andy => y1_to_int == y2_to_int + 1, for all y1, y2 in years.

-   The cycling trip was before the hunting vacation:
    This is a constraint that states that the cycling trip was before the hunting vacation. So:
    Cycling < Hunting.

Clues:
Ginger was either the person who paid $160 or Vicki's client.
Beulah paid 10 dollars more than Yvonne's client.
Hannah paid less than Debra.
Vicki's client paid more than Debra.
Debra paid less than Pam's client.

Entities:
clients: Beulah, Debra, Ginger, Hannah
prices: $150, $160, $170, $180
masseuses: Lynda, Pam, Vicki, Yvonne
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Beulah == 1, and Price150 == 1, and Lynda == 1, then Beulah paid $150 to Lynda.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the clients: Beulah, Debra, Ginger, Hannah (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:

    This is a constraint that states that Ginger is either the person who paid $160 or Vicki's client, but not both. Thus:
    Xor([Ginger == Price160, Ginger == Vicki]).

-   Beulah paid 10 dollars more than Yvonne's client:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of prices to Beulah and Yvonne's client, such that Beulah's price is 10 dollars more than Yvonne's client's price. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Beulah and p2 == Yvonne => p1_to_int == p2_to_int + 10, for all p1, p2 in prices.

-   Hannah paid less than Debra:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of prices to Hannah and Debra, such that Hannah's price is less than Debra's price. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Hannah and p2 == Debra => p1_to_int < p2_to_int, for all p1, p2 in prices.

-   Vicki's client paid more than Debra:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of prices to Vicki's client and Debra, such that Vicki's client's price is more than Debra's price. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Vicki and p2 == Debra => p1_to_int > p2_to_int, for all p1, p2 in prices.

-   Debra paid less than Pam's client:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of prices to Debra and Pam's client, such that Debra's price is less than Pam's client's price. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Debra and p2 == Pam => p1_to_int < p2_to_int, for all p1, p2 in prices.
### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same triplet. For example, if Beulah == 1, and Price150 == 1, and Lynda == 1, then Beulah paid $150 to Lynda.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the clients: Beulah, Debra, Ginger, Hannah (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Prices paid by the clients: Price150, Price160, Price170, Price180 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Names of the masseuses: Lynda, Pam, Vicki, Yvonne (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   Ginger was either the person who paid $160 or Vicki's client:
    This is a constraint that states that Ginger is either the person who paid $160 or Vicki's client, but not both. Thus:
    Xor([Ginger == Price160, Ginger == Vicki]).

-   Beulah paid 10 dollars more than Yvonne's client:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of prices to Beulah and Yvonne's client, such that Beulah's price is 10 dollars more than Yvonne's client's price. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Beulah and p2 == Yvonne => p1_to_int == p2_to_int + 10, for all p1, p2 in prices.

-   Hannah paid less than Debra:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of prices to Hannah and Debra, such that Hannah's price is less than Debra's price. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Hannah and p2 == Debra => p1_to_int < p2_to_int, for all p1, p2 in prices.

-   Vicki's client paid more than Debra:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of prices to Vicki's client and Debra, such that Vicki's client's price is more than Debra's price. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Vicki and p2 == Debra => p1_to_int > p2_to_int, for all p1, p2 in prices.

-   Debra paid less than Pam's client:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of prices to Debra and Pam's client, such that Debra's price is less than Pam's client's price. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Debra and p2 == Pam => p1_to_int < p2_to_int, for all p1, p2 in prices.
