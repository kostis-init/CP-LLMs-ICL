### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Zachary == 1, and 21minutes == 1, and Aquamarine == 1, then Zachary wore the aquamarine shirt and finished in 21 minutes.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the runners: Franklin, Salvador, Ted, Zachary (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Finishing times of the runners: Time21, Time22, Time23, Time24 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Shirt colors of the runners: Aquamarine, Black, Cyan, Maroon (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   Zachary wore the aquamarine shirt:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Zachary == Aquamarine.

-   The contestant in the cyan shirt finished 1 minute after Franklin:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the finishing times for the contestant in the cyan shirt and Franklin, such that the cyan shirt's finishing time is 1 minute after Franklin's finishing time. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    t1 == Cyan and t2 == Franklin => t1_to_int == t2_to_int + 1, for all t1, t2 in times.

-   Zachary finished 2 minutes after Salvador:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the finishing times for Zachary and Salvador, such that Zachary's finishing time is 2 minutes after Salvador's finishing time. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    t1 == Zachary and t2 == Salvador => t1_to_int == t2_to_int + 2, for all t1, t2 in times.

-   The contestant in the maroon shirt finished 1 minute before Salvador:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the finishing times for the contestant in the maroon shirt and Salvador, such that the maroon shirt's finishing time is 1 minute before Salvador's finishing time. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    t1 == Maroon and t2 == Salvador => t1_to_int == t2_to_int - 1, for all t1, t2 in times.
