### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if ColorBlinds == 1, and First == 1, and Green == 1, then Color Blinds finished first and used green paintballs.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the teams: ColorBlinds, NightNinjas, OilCrew, TargetBombs (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Rankings of the teams: First, Second, Third, Fourth (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Colors of the paintballs: Green, Orange, Purple, White (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The Color Blinds finished first:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    ColorBlinds == First.

-   The Color Blinds was ranked 1 place ahead of the green team:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the rankings for the Color Blinds and the green team, such that the Color Blinds' ranking is 1 place ahead of the green team's ranking. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    r1 == ColorBlinds and r2 == Green => r1_to_int == r2_to_int - 1, for all r1, r2 in rankings.

-   The Target Bombs uses white paintballs:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    TargetBombs == White.

-   Of the Oil Crew and the orange team, one finished third and the other finished second:
    This is a constraint that states that for the Oil Crew and the orange team, one finished third and the other finished second, but not both. So:
    Xor([
        (OilCrew == Third, Orange == Second),
        (OilCrew == Second, Orange == Third)
    ]).
