Let's solve the logic grid puzzle step by step.

1. From "Hannah paid more than Teri's client", we know that Hannah did not pay $150 and Teri's client is not Hannah.

2. From "Freda paid 20 dollars more than Lynda's client", we know that Freda did not pay $150, and Lynda's client is not Freda. Also, Freda must have paid either $170 or $180.

3. From "Hannah paid 10 dollars less than Nancy's client", we know that Hannah did not pay $180 and Nancy's client is not Hannah. Also, Hannah must have paid either $150 or $160.

4. From "Nancy's client, Hannah, and Ginger were all different clients", we know that Nancy's client is not Ginger and Ginger is not Hannah.

5. From "Hannah was either the person who paid $180 or Lynda's client", we know that Hannah did not pay $180, so Hannah must be Lynda's client. And since Hannah must have paid either $150 or $160, and she paid more than Teri's client, Hannah paid $160 and Teri's client paid $150.

6. Since Hannah paid $160 and she paid 10 dollars less than Nancy's client, Nancy's client paid $170.

7. Since Freda paid 20 dollars more than Lynda's client and Lynda's client is Hannah who paid $160, Freda paid $180.

8. Now, the only price left is $150, which must be the price that Ginger paid.

9. For the masseuses, the only one left for Hannah is Lynda, for Ginger is Teri, for Freda is Whitney, and for Aimee (the only client left) is Nancy.

So, the final assignment is:
Hannah paid $160 and her masseuse was Lynda.
Ginger paid $150 and her masseuse was Teri.
Freda paid $180 and her masseuse was Whitney.
Aimee paid $170 and her masseuse was Nancy.

### FINAL ANSWER: {"mappings": [{"Hannah", "$160", "Lynda"}, {"Ginger", "$150", "Teri"}, {"Freda", "$180", "Whitney"}, {"Aimee", "$170", "Nancy"}]}
