### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Ginger == 1, and 2007 == 1, and Bulldog == 1, then Ginger's dog, which is a bulldog, won in 2007.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the owners: Anita, Elsie, Fernando, Ginger (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Years of winning: Year2006, Year2007, Year2008, Year2009 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Breeds of the dogs: Bulldog, Dalmatian, IrishSetter, Maltese (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The dalmatian won 1 year after Fernando's canine:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the years for the dalmatian and Fernando's dog, such that the dalmatian's winning year is 1 year after Fernando's dog's winning year. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    y1 == Dalmatian and y2 == Fernando => y1_to_int == y2_to_int + 1, for all y1, y2 in years.

-   Ginger's dog won 1 year before the irish setter:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the years for Ginger's dog and the irish setter, such that Ginger's dog's winning year is 1 year before the irish setter's winning year. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    y1 == Ginger and y2 == IrishSetter => y1_to_int == y2_to_int - 1, for all y1, y2 in years.

-   Ginger's canine is the bulldog:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Ginger == Bulldog.

-   The four dogs are the dog that won in 2006, the dalmatian, the bulldog, and Elsie's dog:
    This is a constraint that states that all these entities are different, thus:
    AllDifferent([Year2006, Dalmatian, Bulldog, Elsie]).
