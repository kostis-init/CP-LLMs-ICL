### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same quartet. For example, if DeepShadow == 1, and 2007 == 1, and ArnoldAshley == 1, then Deep Shadow started in 2007 and is Arnold Ashley.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the superheroes: DeepShadow, GreenAvenger, MaxFusion, UltraHex (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Start years of the superheroes: Year2007, Year2008, Year2009, Year2010 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Real names of the superheroes: ArnoldAshley, LyleLucas, OrelOsborne, RedReilly (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The four people are the person who started in 2007, Green Avenger, Deep Shadow, and Lyle Lucas:
    This is a constraint that states that all these entities are different, thus:
    AllDifferent([Year2007, GreenAvenger, DeepShadow, LyleLucas]).

-   Arnold Ashley began 1 year after Ultra Hex:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the start years for Arnold Ashley and Ultra Hex, such that Arnold Ashley's start year is 1 year after Ultra Hex's start year. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    y1 == ArnoldAshley and y2 == UltraHex => y1_to_int == y2_to_int + 1, for all y1, y2 in years.

-   The person who started in 2009 is Arnold Ashley:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Year2009 == ArnoldAshley.

-   Green Avenger is Orel Osborne:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    GreenAvenger == OrelOsborne.
