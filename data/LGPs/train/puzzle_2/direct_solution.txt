Let's solve this step by step.

1. "Vasquez will leave sometime after Macdonald" - Vasquez did not leave in January and Macdonald did not leave in April.

2. "Vasquez will leave 1 month before the ambassador with the 5 day visit" - Vasquez did not leave in April and the ambassador with the 5 day visit did not leave in January. Also, Vasquez did not have the 5 day visit.

3. "Gilbert is either the person leaving in January or the ambassador with the 4 day visit" - If Gilbert did not leave in January, then he must have the 4 day visit.

4. "Macdonald will leave 1 month before the ambassador with the 4 day visit" - Macdonald did not leave in March or April and the ambassador with the 4 day visit did not leave in January. Also, Macdonald did not have the 4 day visit.

5. "The ambassador with the 4 day visit will leave sometime before the ambassador with the 9 day visit" - The ambassador with the 4 day visit did not leave in April and the ambassador with the 9 day visit did not leave in January.

From these constraints, we can deduce:

- From constraints 1 and 4, Macdonald must leave in January. Therefore, Vasquez cannot leave in February. Vasquez must leave in March.
- From constraint 2, the ambassador with the 5 day visit must leave in April. Since Pickett is the only one left for April, Pickett has the 5 day visit.
- From constraint 3, since Gilbert did not leave in January, he must have the 4 day visit. Therefore, Gilbert must leave in February.
- From constraint 5, the ambassador with the 9 day visit cannot leave in February. Therefore, Vasquez must have the 9 day visit.
- Macdonald cannot have the 4 day visit, so he must have the 10 day visit. Therefore, the only visit left for Gilbert is the 4 day visit.
- The only one left for March is Aimee, so Aimee must leave in March and have the 10 day visit.

The final assignment is:

- Macdonald leaves in January and has a 10 day visit.
- Gilbert leaves in February and has a 4 day visit.
- Vasquez leaves in March and has a 9 day visit.
- Pickett leaves in April and has a 5 day visit.

### FINAL ANSWER: {"mappings": [{"Macdonald", "January", "10 day"}, {"Gilbert", "February", "4 day"}, {"Vasquez", "March", "9 day"}, {"Pickett", "April", "5 day"}]}
