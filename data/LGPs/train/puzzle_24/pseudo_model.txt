### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Florence == 1, and Price6 == 1, and Fettuccine == 1, then Florence paid $6 for fettuccine.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the runners: Florence, Margie, Suzanne, Velma (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Prices paid by the runners: Price6, Price7, Price8, Price9 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Types of pasta ordered: Fettuccine, Fusilli, Spaghetti, Taglioni (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   Suzanne paid less than Margie:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the prices for Suzanne and Margie, such that Suzanne's price is less than Margie's price. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Suzanne and p2 == Margie => p1_to_int < p2_to_int, for all p1, p2 in prices.

-   Margie paid $7:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Margie == Price7.

-   The competitor who ordered spaghetti paid 2 dollars more than the competitor who ordered taglioni:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the prices for spaghetti and taglioni, such that spaghetti's price is 2 dollars more than taglioni's price. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Spaghetti and p2 == Taglioni => p1_to_int == p2_to_int + 2, for all p1, p2 in prices.

-   Of the runner who paid $9 and the contestant who ordered fettuccine, one was Margie and the other was Velma:
    This is a constraint that states that for the runner who paid $9 and the contestant who ordered fettuccine, one is Margie and the other is Velma, but not both. So:
    Xor([
        (Price9 == Margie, Fettuccine == Velma),
        (Price9 == Velma, Fettuccine == Margie)
    ]).
