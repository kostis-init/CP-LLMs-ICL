### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Banion == 1, and $550 == 1, and DM5000 == 1, then the model made by Banion costs $550 and is the DM-5000 camera.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the companies: Banion, Dayero, Honwa, Torvia (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Prices of the cameras: Price550, Price575, Price600, Price625 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Names of the cameras: DM5000, FC520, MX827, Zenix2C (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The model made by Torvia costs 25 dollars more than the model made by Honwa:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the prices for the model made by Torvia and the model made by Honwa, such that Torvia's model's price is 25 dollars more than Honwa's model's price. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Torvia and p2 == Honwa => p1_to_int == p2_to_int + 25, for all p1, p2 in prices.

-   The camera made by Honwa is either the Zenix 2C or the MX-827:
    This is a constraint that states that the camera made by Honwa's model is either Zenix 2C or MX-827, but not both. So:
    Xor([Honwa == Zenix2C, Honwa == MX827]).

-   Of the $600 model and the FC-520, one is made by Honwa and the other is made by Dayero:
    This is a constraint that states that for the $600 model and the FC-520, one is associated with Honwa and the other with Dayero, but not both. So:
    Xor([
        (Price600 == Honwa, FC520 == Dayero),
        (Price600 == Dayero, FC520 == Honwa)
    ]).

-   The Zenix 2C costs less than the FC-520:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the prices for the Zenix 2C and the FC-520, such that Zenix 2C's price is less than FC-520's price. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    p1 == Zenix2C and p2 == FC520 => p1_to_int < p2_to_int, for all p1, p2 in prices.
