### Plan:
Each entity will be represented by a decision variable that will take a value from 1 to 4. All decision variables with the same value will correspond to the same pairing. For example, if Dominica == 1, and Gold1 == 1, and Silver2 == 1, then Dominica won 1 gold medal and 2 silver medals.

### Decision variables:
-   Names of the countries: Dominica, Jordan, Venezuela, Zimbabwe (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Number of gold medals won: Gold1, Gold2, Gold3, Gold4 (all different, 1 to 4)
-   Number of silver medals won: Silver2, Silver5, Silver6, Silver8 (all different, 1 to 4)

### Constraints:
-   The team from Venezuela finished with 4 gold medals:
    This is a direct assignment constraint:
    Venezuela == Gold4.

-   The squad that won 2 gold medals ended with 6 silver medals:
    This is a direct assignment constraint linking gold medals to silver medals:
    Gold2 == Silver6.

-   The four teams were the squad from Zimbabwe, the team that won 3 gold medals, the squad that won 6 silver medals, and the squad that won 8 silver medals:
    This is a constraint that states that all these entities are different, thus:
    AllDifferent([Zimbabwe, Gold3, Silver6, Silver8]).

-   The team from Dominica ended the games with 1 fewer gold medal than the squad that won 5 silver medals:
    For this, we will need to add a constraint for each possible assignment of the number of gold medals for Dominica and the squad that won 5 silver medals, such that Dominica's gold medals are 1 less than the squad's gold medals that won 5 silver medals. So, the constraints will be of the form:
    g1 == Dominica and g2 == Silver5 => g1 == g2 - 1, for all g1, g2 in gold medals.
