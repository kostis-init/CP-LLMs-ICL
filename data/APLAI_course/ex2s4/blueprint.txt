Decision Variables:
    Define binary variables in_S and in_T, each of size 10, to represent whether each element of A is in subset S or T respectively.

Domains:
    Each variable in in_S and in_T has a domain of {0, 1}. The value 1 indicates that the corresponding element of A is in the subset, and 0 indicates that it is not.

Constraints:
    Equal Sum: The sum of the elements in S must equal the sum of the elements in T. This can be represented by the equation:
    sum(in_S * A) = sum(in_T * A)

    Disjoint Sets: S and T are disjoint, so there is no element that is in both S and T. This can be represented by the equation:
    sum(in_S * in_T) = 0

    Non-Empty Sets: S and T are non-empty. This can be represented by the inequalities:
    sum(in_S) > 0
    sum(in_T) > 0

Objective:
    There is no specific objective in this problem as we are not asked to maximize or minimize anything. We are just looking for a feasible solution that satisfies the constraints.
