BLUEPRINT:
Decision Variables:
    Define integer variables B, C, F, M, S to represent the floor numbers where Baker, Cooper, Fletcher, Miller, and Smith live respectively.

Domains:
    Each variable has a domain of [1, 5] as there are five floors in the apartment house.

Constraints:
    Baker: Baker does not live on the fifth floor. This can be represented as:
    B != 5

    Cooper: Cooper does not live on the first floor. This can be represented as:
    C != 1

    Fletcher: Fletcher does not live on either the fifth or the first floor. This can be represented as:
    F != 5, F != 1

    Miller: Miller lives on a higher floor than does Cooper. This can be represented as:
    M > C

    Smith: Smith does not live on a floor adjacent to Fletcher. This can be represented as:
    | S - F | != 1

    Fletcher: Fletcher does not live on a floor adjacent to Cooper. This can be represented as:
    | F - C | != 1

    Different Floors: All variables must be different as they all live on different floors. This can be represented as:
    AllDifferent([B, C, F, M, S])

Objective:
    There is no objective function in this problem as we are not optimizing anything. We are simply finding a feasible solution that satisfies all the constraints.
