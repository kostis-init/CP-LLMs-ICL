My bank card has a 4 digit pin, abcd. I use the following facts to help me
remember it:
• no two digits are the same
• the 2-digit number cd is 3 times the 2-digit number ab
• the 2-digit number da is 2 times the 2-digit number bc
What is my pin?

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:
```json
{
    "a": int,
    "b": int,
    "c": int,
    "d": int
}
```

For example, if the pin is 1234, the answer should be:
```json
{
    "a": 1,
    "b": 2,
    "c": 3,
    "d": 4
}
```
