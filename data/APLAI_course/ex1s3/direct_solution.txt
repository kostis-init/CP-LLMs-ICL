To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the point where the boy has no apples left after giving one to the girl. We'll calculate how many apples he must have had before each gate to ensure that after giving half of his apples plus one to each guard, he ends up with exactly zero apples after the final gift to the girl.

Let's denote the number of apples the boy has before passing through each gate as \( x_i \), where \( x_5 \) is the number of apples he has just before the fifth gate, and so on, down to \( x_0 \), which is the number of apples he starts with.

### Step 1: After the last gate
After giving the last apple to the girl, he has 0 apples. Therefore, just before giving the apple to the girl, he must have had 1 apple (since he gives the last one to her).

### Step 2: Calculate backwards from each gate
We know that at each gate, the boy gives away half of his apples plus one. We can express this as:
\[ x_{\text{after}} = x_{\text{before}} - \left(\frac{x_{\text{before}}}{2} + 1\right) \]
\[ x_{\text{after}} = \frac{x_{\text{before}}}{2} - 1 \]

To find \( x_{\text{before}} \), we rearrange the equation:
\[ x_{\text{before}} = 2(x_{\text{after}} + 1) \]

### Step 3: Apply the formula for each gate
- Before gate 5 (\( x_4 \)): \( x_5 = 1 \)
  \[ x_4 = 2(1 + 1) = 4 \]
- Before gate 4 (\( x_3 \)):
  \[ x_3 = 2(4 + 1) = 10 \]
- Before gate 3 (\( x_2 \)):
  \[ x_2 = 2(10 + 1) = 22 \]
- Before gate 2 (\( x_1 \)):
  \[ x_1 = 2(22 + 1) = 46 \]
- Before gate 1 (\( x_0 \)):
  \[ x_0 = 2(46 + 1) = 94 \]

### Conclusion
The boy must have started with 94 apples to end up with exactly zero after giving one apple to the girl and satisfying the conditions at each gate.

### FINAL ANSWER: {"apples": 94}
