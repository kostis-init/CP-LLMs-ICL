Decision Variables:
    Define binary variables A, B, C, D, E, F to represent whether Artie, Bill, Crackitt, Dodgy, Edgy, and Fingers are guilty (1) or innocent (0).

Domains:
    Each of the six variables can take on a value of either 0 (innocent) or 1 (guilty).

Constraints:
    Number of Guilty: At least four of them are innocent, so at most two of them are guilty. This can be represented as:
    A + B + C + D + E + F <= 2

    Artie's Statement ("It wasn't me."): If Artie is innocent (A=0), then his statement is true and he is not guilty. If Artie is guilty (A=1), then his statement is false and he is guilty. This can be represented as:
    A = A

    Bill's Statement ("Crackitt was in it up to his neck."): If Bill is innocent (B=0), then his statement is true and Crackitt is guilty (C=1). If Bill is guilty (B=1), then his statement is false and Crackitt is innocent (C=0). This can be represented as:
    B = ~C

    Crackitt's Statement ("No I wasn't.") can be represented as:
    C = C

    Dodgy's statement ("If Crackitt did it, Bill did it with him.") can be represented as:
    D = C -> B

    Edgy's statement ("Nobody did it alone.") can be represented as:
    E = (A + B + C + D + E + F) > 1

    Fingers' statement ("Thatâ€™s right: it was Artie and Dodgy together.") can be represented as:
    F = A & D

Objective:
    There is no objective function in this problem as we are not optimizing anything. We are simply finding a feasible solution that satisfies all the constraints.
