Decision Variables:
    Define binary variables for each movie to represent whether the movie is selected (1) or not (0). The variable 'selected_movies' is an array of size equal to the number of movies (9 in this case).

Domains:
    selected_movies[i] âˆˆ {0, 1} for each movie i. The value 1 indicates that the movie is selected, and 0 indicates that it is not selected.

Constraints:
    Non-Overlapping Shows: Two selected movies cannot overlap. This can be represented by iterating over the movies and for each pair of movies (i, j), if the interval of movie i overlaps with the interval of movie j, add a constraint that at most one of movie i and movie j can be selected. This can be represented as:
    For each pair of movies i, j:
    If end_time[i] > start_time[j] and end_time[j] > start_time[i], then selected_movies[i] + selected_movies[j] <= 1.

Objective:
    Maximize Number of Shows: Aim to maximize the number of selected movies. This can be represented by adding a maximize objective to the model with the sum of the 'selected_movies' array as the objective.
