Please schedule non-overlapping movie showings at a cinema to maximize the number of shows one can watch.

Here is the data:
{
    "num_movies": 9,
    "movies": [
        {"title": "Tarjan of the Jungle", "interval": [4, 13]},
        {"title": "The Four Volume Problem", "interval": [17, 27]},
        {"title": "The President's Algorist", "interval": [1, 10]},
        {"title": "Steiner's Tree", "interval": [12, 18]},
        {"title": "Process Terminated", "interval": [23, 30]},
        {"title": "Halting State", "interval": [9, 16]},
        {"title": "Programming Challenges", "interval": [19, 25]},
        {"title": "Discrete Mathematics", "interval": [2, 7]},
        {"title": "Calculated Bets", "interval": [26, 31]}
    ]
}

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:
```json
{
    "selected_movies": [0 | 1]
}
```

where 0 or 1 is the binary value indicating whether the movie is selected or not, in the same order as the input.

For example, a valid JSON (but not the correct answer) would be:
```json
{
    "selected_movies": [1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
}
```

where the selected movies are Tarjan of the Jungle, The President's Algorist and Steiner's Tree.
