Decision Variables:
    Define integer variables a, b, c, d to represent the four different numbers.

Domains:
    Each variable has a domain of [1, 100] as the numbers are between 1 and 100.

Constraints:
    Different Numbers: All variables must be different as the numbers are different. This can be represented as:
    AllDifferent([a, b, c, d])

    Sum of Squares: The sum of the squares of the first two numbers is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two numbers. This can be represented as:
    a^2 + b^2 = c^2 + d^2

Objective:
    There is no objective function in this problem as we are not optimizing anything. We are simply finding a feasible solution that satisfies all the constraints.
