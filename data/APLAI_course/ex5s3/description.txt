Find a combination of 4 different numbers between 1 and 100, such that the sum of the squares of the two first numbers is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two numbers, i.e. a^2 + b^2 = c^2 + d^2 for some a, b, c, d in {1, 100}, a != b != c != d.

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:
```json
{
    "a": int,
    "b": int,
    "c": int,
    "d": int
}
```
where a, b, c, d are the numbers that satisfy the condition, i.e. a^2 + b^2 = c^2 + d^2.
