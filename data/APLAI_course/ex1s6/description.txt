Alice has to give Bob change of 199 euros. She has 6 different types of coins of different value ([1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50]) and she has a certain number of coins of each value available ([20, 10, 15, 8, 4, 2]). How can the change be composed with the available coins minimizing the number of coins used?

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:
```json
{
    "coin_counts": [int]
}
```

For example, if she gives to Bob 1 coin of value 1 and 3 coins of value 25, then the answer should be:
```json
{
    "coin_counts": [1, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0]
}
```
