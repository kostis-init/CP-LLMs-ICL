Decision Variables:
    Define integer variables for each step to represent the number of steps taken at that move. The variable 'steps' is an array of size equal to the total number of steps (20 in this case).

Domains:
    Each variable in 'steps' has a domain of [0, m2] as the number of steps taken at each move can be between 0 and m2.

Constraints:
    Total Steps: The sum of steps should equal the total number of stairs. This can be represented as:
    sum(steps) == n

    Steps Range: The number of steps taken at each move should be between m1 and m2 or 0. This can be represented as:
    (steps[i] >= m1) | (steps[i] == 0) for i in range(n)
    steps[i] <= m2 for i in range(n)

    Trailing Zeros: If a step is 0, then all the following steps should be 0. This can be represented as:
    (steps[i - 1] == 0).implies(all(steps[j] == 0 for j in range(i, n)))

Objective:
    There is no objective function in this problem as we are not optimizing anything. We are simply finding a feasible solution that satisfies all the constraints.
