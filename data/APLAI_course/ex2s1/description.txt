We want to assign a different colour to the following countries: Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Netherlands and Luxembourg.
Two neighbouring countries cannot have the same colour.
Read the data below with the graph representing the adjacency of the countries: each pair (i; j) means that country i is adjacent to country j.
You can use integers starting from 1 to represent the colours.
Find a colouring that minimizes the number of colours used.

Here is the data:
{
    "num_edges": 9,
    "graph": [
        [3, 1],
        [3, 6],
        [3, 4],
        [6, 4],
        [6, 1],
        [1, 5],
        [1, 4],
        [4, 5],
        [4, 2]
    ],
    "nodes": ["Belgium", "Denmark", "France", "Germany", "Netherlands", "Luxembourg"]
}

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:
```json
{
    "colors": [int]
}
```
where the list of integers represents the colours assigned to the countries in the order they are given in the input.

For example, a valid JSON (not the answer) would be:
```json
{
    "colors": [1, 2, 4, 2, 3, 5]
}
```
