To find a magic square of size 4x4, we need to arrange the numbers from 1 to 16 (since \(4^2 = 16\)) such that the sum of the numbers in each row, column, and both diagonals equals the same number. The magic constant \(M\) for a 4x4 magic square can be calculated using the formula:
\[ M = n \left(\frac{n^2 + 1}{2}\right) \]
For \(n = 4\):
\[ M = 4 \left(\frac{16 + 1}{2}\right) = 4 \times 8.5 = 34 \]

Now, we need to arrange the numbers 1 through 16 in a 4x4 grid such that each row, column, and diagonal sums to 34. One of the known solutions for a 4x4 magic square is:

\[
\begin{array}{cccc}
16 & 2 & 3 & 13 \\
5 & 11 & 10 & 8 \\
9 & 7 & 6 & 12 \\
4 & 14 & 15 & 1 \\
\end{array}
\]

Let's verify that each row, column, and diagonal sums to 34:

- **Rows:**
  - Row 1: \(16 + 2 + 3 + 13 = 34\)
  - Row 2: \(5 + 11 + 10 + 8 = 34\)
  - Row 3: \(9 + 7 + 6 + 12 = 34\)
  - Row 4: \(4 + 14 + 15 + 1 = 34\)

- **Columns:**
  - Column 1: \(16 + 5 + 9 + 4 = 34\)
  - Column 2: \(2 + 11 + 7 + 14 = 34\)
  - Column 3: \(3 + 10 + 6 + 15 = 34\)
  - Column 4: \(13 + 8 + 12 + 1 = 34\)

- **Diagonals:**
  - Diagonal 1 (top left to bottom right): \(16 + 11 + 6 + 1 = 34\)
  - Diagonal 2 (top right to bottom left): \(13 + 10 + 7 + 4 = 34\)

This arrangement satisfies all the conditions of a magic square for size 4.

### FINAL ANSWER: {"magic_square": [[16, 2, 3, 13], [5, 11, 10, 8], [9, 7, 6, 12], [4, 14, 15, 1]]}
