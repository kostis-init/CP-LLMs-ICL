At the hospital n people are on a waiting list for a kidneyâ€™s transplant. We have the information about the compatibility between these people as a directed graph: compatible[i] is the set of people to which i can donate. Given this information, we want to maximize the number of people that receive a new kidney: anyone who gives a kidney must receive one, and no person receives more than one kidney. Use the following data:

{
    "num_people": 8,
    "compatible": [  // 1-based index
        [2, 3],
        [1, 6],
        [1, 4, 7],
        [2],
        [2],
        [5],
        [8],
        [3]
    ]
}

It is mandatory that the answer should be given according to the following JSON schema:
```json
{
    "transplants": [[0 | 1]]
}
```

Where transplants[i][j] is 1 if person i gives a kidney to person j, and 0 otherwise.

For example, a valid JSON (but not the answer for the example above) would be:
```json
{
    "transplants": [
        [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
    ]
}
```
