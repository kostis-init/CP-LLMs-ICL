Decision Variables:
    Define binary variables for each pair of people to represent whether person i gives a kidney to person j (1) or not (0). The variable 'transplants' is a matrix of size equal to the number of people (8 in this case).

Domains:
    transplants[i][j] âˆˆ {0, 1} for each pair of people i, j. The value 1 indicates that person i gives a kidney to person j, and 0 indicates that they do not.

Constraints:
    Anyone who gives a kidney must receive one. This can be represented by iterating over the people and for each person i, add a constraint that if the sum of the row i in the 'transplants' matrix is greater than or equal to 1, then the sum of the column i in the 'transplants' matrix must also be greater than or equal to 1.
    Each person can donate to at most one person and receive from at most one person. This can be represented by adding a constraint that the sum of the row i and the sum of the column i in the 'transplants' matrix must both be less than or equal to 1.
    Compatibility constraint: if person i can't donate to person j, then transplants[i][j] must be 0. This can be represented by iterating over the 'compatible' list and for each person i and their compatible people, add a constraint that if person j is not in the compatible list of person i, then transplants[i][j] must be 0.

Objective:
    Maximize the number of transplants. This can be represented by adding a maximize objective to the model with the sum of the 'transplants' matrix as the objective.
